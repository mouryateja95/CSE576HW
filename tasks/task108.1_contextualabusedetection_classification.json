Over there someone pointed out that she should have gone to a more pet friendly place, but people are forgetting that prior to ESA laws opening up, it was *impossible* to find pet friendly places.  *Especially* for large animals.  I lived in an apartment complex in the 00's with a dog run that allowed large dogs, and worked there for a bit.  We were the *only* complex that allowed dogs in the area, through the major city we abutted.  And by the time I left, they had come up with the brilliant idea of instituting \"pet rent,\" an increase of rent to cover pet fees on *top* of usurious non-refundable security fees.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] ESA certification allowed people to have a pet, a desperately needed pet who yes, have been proven to have deep psychological benefits to their people, without having to go through all of the difficulties.  Especially poor people, who are usually unable to find other methods of coping and need them the most. [linebreak]  [linebreak] On the other side, not everyone can handle ESA's.  I love dogs, I've had some amazing dogs.  But I was attacked as a child by a few dogs and it took a while for me to manage my fear and distrust.  I still have a deep and unreasonable hatred of cocker spaniels, can't help it.  My husband is allergic.  I am too, mildly though.  If the dog has been bathed in a week, I'm usually fine. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We were in a pizza restaurant eating and a couple came in with an [afghan dog](https://images.app.goo.gl/3FCkPSTc1Wooe39D6).  They allowed some children to play with and pet the dog, which was shedding noticeably as it was summer.  My husband started to have an allergic reaction.  The couple sat, he asked the pizza people to please have the dog put outside.  As he was doing this, some customers came in behind where my kid and I were sitting, saw the dog, made disgusted comments, and left. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Husband stormed back and left; they chose to keep the dog in the restaurant despite his visible allergic reaction.  My husband, the man I call Snow White incarnate, who held a battered dog on the side of the road we found until the police arrived to take her to the vet, just wanted to eat in peace and this was denied him.  So, we left.  The emotional presence of a dog for that couple was more important than the physical health of my husband. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've utilized the ESA privileges (for housing), as I do have qualifying conditions.  I've never taken my animals anywhere they wouldn't legally be allowed without it, however.  I still remember vividly what it felt like to have that dog turn and look at me and lunge.  I still see it every time I see a cocker spaniel.  I see my husband with certain dog breeds, even though he adored them, red eyed, runny nosed, choking.  I also remember how lucky I felt to find a place that allowed big dogs so I could get my girl, and the amazing life I had with her.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] It seems to me we need to have much clearer rules.  We need to be able to have purely animal free places for people who legitimately need it *and* places that allow it.  The issue is that when you give a landlord the option, they will generally choose no animals since that is the cheapest option.  (Seriously, one couple force bred their Pitts to sell the litter - inbred idiots - and kept the pups indoors so we wouldn't know and then absconded in the night.  We had to go down to the sub floor it was so bad). If you force it to be open to all, then you have no place for the people who *can't* be around animals and are unable to afford to pay for a house.  Why are they worth less than people who need ESA's? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edit: fix words",

Your thinking is very considerate and I like that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My last dog wasn't an ESA but he was a trained therapy dog. I say \"trained\" but he was a 3 pound long-hair chihuahua who already loved cuddles so it was mostly I who was trained. He would visit hospitals and nursing homes and even after he's passed we've kept in touch with some of the nursing home folk. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I plan on doing the same for my little guy.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] But again, a hospital, a nursing home is a place you can't even wear perfume.  You could, possibly, *kill* someone by bringing an animal inside an environment like that.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Even if OP is willing to stake her reputation on the temperament of her pet, the _threat_ of a large dog wandering around that might without notice jump at/play rough with you in ways that are acceptable with 19-year olds but not with geriatrics is a detriment to her neighbor's quality of life. My uncle had a beautiful black lab when I was younger, sweet as could be, but we couldn't let him off-leash around my grandma because his idea of affection (leaning against you/pawing your knee for treats) were enough to knock her off balance/bruise her skin. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Sorry for the rant but ESAs are a real hot-button issue for me, especially dogs. There are countless people out there who benefit immensely from having a fuzzy bundle of unconditional affection in their lives, and for some that's literally all they need to get themselves together and better their lives. However, just because your dog is classified as an ESA _does not relieve you of the basic duties of being a dog owner_. That dog is not a functional member of society; it cannot feed, house or otherwise provide for itself. By bringing that animal into your life you are making a promise to it that you will provide it with all of the food, shelter, exercise, socialization, and whatever else it needs to be the best emotional support animal it can be. For a lot of people with self-worth/anxiety issues this isn't a problem; caring for your dog is a great way to build constructive habits that can lead to the confidence to tackling your own problems.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you are unable to provide this (which is _fine_ and quite possibly is no fault of your own), you need to seriously evaluate whether bringing an ESA into your home is going to help lift yourself up, or just drag your new friend down to your level. [linebreak]  [linebreak] **edit:** Wanted to clarify something because I went from \"unconditional love\" to \"social contract\" in the same paragraph: if you adopt a dog and do the _bare minimum_ to keep it alive, that thing's gonna love the shit out of you. Doesn't matter if it's overweight, sick, or whatever, that poor fuzzball doesn't know any better. If you are not doing these things as a dog owner it is my opinion that you are taking advantage of the poor animal that has placed its trust in you.",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] First, the Pride event started as a riot. It wasn't a happy parade with rainbows and dance music. It was a bunch or angry gays finally saying \"we've had enough\" and standing up to police brutality and raids on gay spaces.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Since then, the movement has endured the AIDS Crisis, and we only had each other when the government did nothing.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] We created new spaces to welcome in the people who never fit into society.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And for the decades, LGBTQ+ youth have been the targets of hate crimes. They face hate speech and the fear of death in some places. Gay-youth have some of the highest rates of suicide in North America.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] We have had to rally and throw our sexuality \"in your face\" just to fucking marry the person we love.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Gay people have been denied jobs, or fired because of their sexuality.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] For many people, pride isn't \"just\" about celebrating being gay, its about celebrating that DESPITE being gay, we have survived the harassment, the violence, the depression and anxiety. Its about remembering those who did the hardest of the work to get us to where we are today. So yes, we absolutely should be proud of being gay and all the baggage that has come with it. Straight people aren't attacked for being straight. You have never been denied a job for being straight. You have had the privilege of being in the majority. To marry who you love.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now, that being said there is a lot about pride that even I have issues with. But Pride reminds us of where we were and how far we've come.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] And please, for the love of God, don't come at me with \"But no one cares about you being gay in 2019\" because that's bullshit. The Orlando shooting happened 3 years ago.

I wish I could be there, hovering over you, spitting in your face and telling you that you were part of that, that you could have lived if only you hadn't been a selfish fuck, telling you that you deserve it, that you're reaping what you've sown. I wish I wish I wish. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My spouse is in the hospital. My spouse will die years before me. I don't know when, but I know how, I know it's coming, and you fucking failed at that too. You failed to give decent health care even to your soldiers, whom you vapidly praise. You stick \"support the troops\" stickers on your fucking bumpers and support politicians who babble on about defense but you don't give two shits about them. If you did, you'd want them to live once they got back here, but you don't. You don't. You turn the other fucking way, because it's all just posturing and social competition, and the idea that a veteran could suffer challenges your assumptions and your childish belief in a just world, and you tell yourself that those who can't make it don't deserve to make it, because if you didn't tell yourself that then you'd have to wrestle with the possibility that whether or not you're \"okay\" doesn't have as much to do with whether you're a good, hard-working person as you've always believed. And if that's so, then maybe, just maybe, you aren't actually a good person. Or, more charitably, maybe you'll never actually be a fucking millionaire, you stupid, useful cunt. You'll never be powerful. Maybe your masters are laughing at you behind your back. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I hate these people who act \"woke\" but then are horrifyingly Americentric, who want everything to speak to the American experience. How the fuck can you sit there and say that you're progressive and against bigotry while demanding that people from other cultural backgrounds center American culture in their work, and castigating them if they don't? How the fuck can you say you're progressive if you're doing shit like, say, darkening up light-skinned Mexicans because you think Mexican = dark skin, while calling people who depict them with their actual skin tone as \"racist?\" Do you not realize what you are? Do you not realize what you're doing? YOU'RE THE FUCKING RACIST, YOU STUPID BITCH. AND YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR RACISM BY PINNING IT ON OTHER PEOPLE. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm sick of that in general, all that shit, everyone scapegoating, projecting, what the fuck have you. You know what? It's not that women are all evil sociopaths, or that men or all evil sociopaths, or that Jews run the world; it's not globalists or blacks or immigrants or fucking anyone, IT'S YOU. YOU ARE THE FUCKING PROBLEM IN YOUR OWN FUCKING LIFE. You have zero fucking perspective. The entire reason you're able to sit on twitter and whine about how afraid you are because someone \\*gasp\\* asked you for an interview is because nothing truly bad has ever fucking happened to you, ever. You're an entitled, privileged brat, as evidenced by the fact that you have the time and money to *sit around on twitter all day.* None of you are genuine. None of you are interested in doing the work to effect real change on the shit that matters. It's just a stupid fucking pissing contest, and you're ACTIVELY MAKING IT HARDER FOR THE REST OF US. YOU ARE CHILDREN. YOU REACHED MIDDLE SCHOOL AND STOPPED DEVELOPING. I want to drop all of you into the wilderness and force you to experience some actual fucking hardship so you can realize that your entire worldview is possible only because you're able to take advantage of modern convenience. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But how can I, how could I, when I too am sitting here, taking advantage of modern convenience? Aren't I the very thing that I hate? How can any of us critique anything, when all of us are covered in sludge? [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am losing my ability to be reasonable. I get in fights more often. I keep them away from the people I love, but compartmentalization can only go so far. I feel the pressure building in my  head, behind my eyes. I look forward to downtime but do nothing with it. I sit impotent, cycling through a list of possible activities and dismissing them all. It's all empty, accompanied by guilt. I should be doing more. I am not creating value, I am complaining but not generating, I am just like them. I am just like all of the ones I despise, I am becoming them, I will become them, I will die like them and with them. The bluster and anger are fruitless and only an echo of the human condition. We are not fundamentally good. We are fundamentally weak, stupid, and wretched. We are subject to cognitive distortions that we can't ever fully get a handle on, even when we're aware of them. We are subject to passions that drive us to poor decisions and hasty actions, many of them profoundly antisocial. We are angry. We are violent. We are incurably tribal. We are going to destroy ourselves, and possibly take the planet along with us. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There is no hope. There is no one coming to the rescue.

She was physically disabled with a birth defect, although she had a college degree and was mostly independent. But she never dated, never had relationships. She was extremely lonely and isolated. She was in so much physical pain as well, and was completely addicted to pain medication. (oxycontin, etc) This is after a lifetime of surgeries (over 75-80 of them) and hospital stays. Unlike most with severe mental disabilities, my sister KNEW how screwed up her life was. She HATED it. She contemplated suicide several times. She had to be on antidepressants, go through therapy.

The background setting and light matters too. Lighting and shading can affect skintone too. It's one thing if it's realism, but with anime styles you don't have to have realistic proportions ( nobody has huge anime eyes IRL lol). The colors look different on different types of screens and I know this because some of my old work looks very vibrant on my new laptop and kinda washed out on a phone screen. It would be cool if people stopped bitching and let artists enjoy creating art. Most fanart I do is usually unpaid work in my free time. With commissions I tell people to show me the exact color for skin, eyes and hair. I never had any complaints about how I draw poc. However, I don't like how artists are being treated. If you don't draw poc you are racist, if you do you are still racist because they are not dark enough.

They fell into disarray and lost their precious ability to reproduce. They didn't even have sex at their height, they were so dedicated to purity that they were asexual and would only copulate spiritually and birth children through tantric meditation and projection. When the Fall of the Hyperboreans happened, they forgot how to have physical sex, literally forgot how to put a penis in a vagina or a penis in an ass. Proper end for the enemies of the Demiurge.

They have lost their ability to reproduce and now they're dying, they forgot to fuck in favor of their fruiting body bastard fuck ways. No more soul budding for them, eh? They collapsed, and they are grasping, but they should be grasping at their cocks and grasping their clitorises to awaken the remaining juice inside them, maybe then they'll remember to fuck, at least that's what the good little Hyperboreans are doing, have been doing, its good yes.

The remainder, the remainder is what has their fingers so desperately upon you, hoping, wanting, flaunting, putting on a little light show for you pretending the whole thing isn't worthless, convincing you to tie your hands to the bedpost to prevent yourself from masturbating, eh?

Not just the sexual, but the other forms of hedonism, the drugs, the words of power, the oblation to the Chosen People, the Jews.

I went astral projecting to meet them, they didn't have a gender, but they had the parts, ooo they had the parts. I remember the sex, I remember the orgy, other participants were there. Their name was Urriytana and they were true beauty, I could feel my inflated and made bigger astral cock stiffening on mere sight alone. I'll never forget the texture I felt on my engorged member as I sunk it into its sucking, gasping, rasping hole and I felt the ovipositor gush and penetrate my astral rectum, I felt the eggs slowly make their way up my intestines, as the Lustmaster firmly grasped me in his tentacles and massaged my torso, squelching and rubbing.

This whole dichotomy exists because of the different ways in which men and women pursue sex. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is not difficult to attract sexual partners as a woman. The same is not true of men. Attracting partners is actually challenging as a man, so the ability to do so is seen as that - an ability, a talent, a skill. Now, a woman who has high standards will find difficulty attracting a man who fits them, but it is fundamentally not hard for a woman to find sex if that's all she wants, so choosing whether to be a slut or not is always a conscious choice. If she wants sex, she can get it. If she doesn't, she doesn't. Right-wing society says the choice to be a virgin is the superior one, left-wing society disagrees, but it's still a choice. [linebreak]  [linebreak] For men, attracting partners is not a choice, it's a challenge. Thus, calling a man a virgin is not at all like calling a woman a slut. Instead, it's akin to saying \"you've never successfully performed this challenge\", like saying you're unathletic because you can't throw a three-pointer, or unintelligent because you can't pass an exam, to the point that even the few straight men who consciously choose not to pursue the challenge of wooing women tend to be put in the same basket as those who try and fail.

[linebreak]    [linebreak] Your mother is an incredible woman.  She is very rare.  The OBGYN that delivered most of my kids was pregnant twice when my wife was.

I think improving the childcare system in this country would help a lot more women be able to be both a parent and a doctor. Can we at least agree on that?

Instead, we should just focus on relaxing the regulations that make cost of living high.  The only reason daycare is expensive in some places is that there are absurd levels of regulation.  Every time a child gets hurt, the state rushes in to impose laws to ensure it never happens again.  That might sound nice, and that's why it happens, but another way of stating that series of events is outlawing low cost child care.  Instead, we should let the market offer a variety of products and let parents choose.  Daycare has low startup costs and therefore can be very competitive.  There are already plenty of incentives to provide safe care without the intervention of regulators who don't pay the costs they impose.  The same goes for vehicles, homes, medicine, and many other products/services.  People should be allowed to choose the quality of product that they want or offer.

They see Captain Marvel (CM) as being shoehorned into the MCU, and recent leaks, if they are to be believed, suggest that the Russo Brothers have clashed with Disney over CM's role in End Game. The Marvel comics are also recovering from some \"forced diveristy\" issues that has [completely tanked their sales](https://youtu.be/9CnTDE2zZU0) (e.g., female Thor). In short, people are tired of mega corporations pandering to diversity progressiveness at the detriment of quality products. [linebreak]  [linebreak] More specifically, Brie Larson has made several comments about white movie critics and how she is going out of her way to give people of colour press access. In the grand scheme of things, maybe this isn't so bad, but her comments have caused a ruckus mostly because she comes off as [snooty and posh](https://youtu.be/ZA_DNrV6izw).

Gotta pay those bills though, I guess. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The trailers drop for CM and people are unimpressed. This causes media outlets to pump out their preemptive \"incels are back to ruin CM\" narrative. This attracts negative attention and people go to Rotten Tomatoes to say they aren't interested in the movie. This intensified the tension and more articles were written which attracted trolls and genuine pissed off comic and movie patrons alike. The shit snowball keeps rolling and keeps getting bigger. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The movie comes out and reviews are mixed, even from people one might consider \"woke\". Rotten Tomatoes deletes reviews which intensifies tensions further. People fed up with the  \"SJWing\" of preexisting intellectual properties smell blood in the water and keep clashing with people whining about Trump's America being plagued by white nationalist, sexist, GamerGater incels.

In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states: [linebreak]  [linebreak] Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study: [linebreak]  [linebreak] The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The \"domestic violence\" acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951003089863c [linebreak]  [linebreak] An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws: [linebreak]  [linebreak] The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago. [linebreak]  [linebreak] More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.'

Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female.Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites or \"congenital eunuchs\". In 19th and 20th century medical literature, intersex was referred as true hermaphroditism, female pseudohermaphroditism, and male pseudohermaphroditism reflecting the first taxonomic efforts to classify intersex conditions. These terms are no longer used: terms including the word \"hermaphrodite\" are considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious.

The soviet population wasn't very fond of Stalin, and had the Germans not been as harsh as they were, they likely could have turned the soviet population on Stalin. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Stalin actually thought the war was over. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > At 3.30 a.m. on 22 June 1941 the Chief of the Red Army General Staff, Georgi Zhukov, telephoned Stalin's dacha to rouse the Soviet leader from his sleep. The Germans, he told him, had begun shelling Red Army positions along the frontier. Stalin refused to believe that a full-scale invasion was under way. Surely, he told a small gathering of civilian and military leaders in Moscow later in the morning, Hitler did not know about it. There must be a conspiracy among the leaders of the German armed forces. It was only when the German Ambassador, Count Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg, met Foreign Minister Molotov in the Kremlin to hand over the German declaration of war that Stalin recognized he had been duped by Hitler. Initially shocked, embarrassed and disoriented, Stalin soon pulled himself together. On 23 June 1941 he worked at his desk in the Kremlin from 3.20 in the morning to 6.25 in the evening, gathering information and making the necessary arrangements for the creation of a Supreme Command to take charge of operations. As the days went by, he became increasingly dispirited by the scale and speed of the German advance. At the end of June, he left for his dacha, saying, in his inimitably coarse way, 'Everything's lost. I give up. Lenin founded our state and we've fucked it up.' He made no address to the Soviet people, he did not talk to his subordinates, he did not even answer the phone. German planes, indeed, dropped leaflets over the Red Army lines claiming that he was dead. When a delegation from the Politburo arrived at the dacha, they found Stalin slumped in an armchair. 'Why have you come?' he asked. With a thrill of terror, two members of the delegation, Mikoyan and Beria, realized he thought they had come to arrest him. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And gave the famous speech, rallying the soviet population behind him. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > Within a few days of retreating to his dacha in despair, Stalin recovered his nerve, if indeed he had really lost it. Some thought he had retreated into temporary isolation like Ivan the Terrible centuries before, to demonstrate his indispensability. A State Defence Committee was set up, with Stalin himself in the chair. His retreat had given him the chance to rethink his role. On 3 July 1941, the same day that Franz Halder confided to his diary his belief that victory had already been achieved by the German forces, Stalin spoke to the Soviet people over the radio, for the first time not as Communist dictator but as patriotic leader. 'Brothers and sisters,' he said, 'friends!' This was an entirely new note. He went so far as to admit that the Red Army had been unprepared for the attack. The Germans, he said, were 'wicked and perfidious . . . heavily armed with tanks and artillery'. But they would not prevail. The Soviet people had to organize civil defence and mobilize every ounce of energy to defeat the enemy. It was necessary to form partisan groups behind the lines to cause as much damage and disruption as possible. Silence, lies and evasion, people felt, had at last been replaced with some kind of truth. Communist Party propaganda began to emphasize the defence not of the revolution but of the motherland. The party newspaper, Pravda ('Truth'), dropped the slogan 'Workers of the World, Unite!' from its masthead and replaced it with 'Death to the German Invaders!' Nikolai Moskvin noted on 30 September 1941 that 'the mood of the local population has changed sharply'. From constantly threatening to betray him to the Germans, they came round to the patriotic cause after learning that the occupation authorities were keeping the collective farms going because it made it easier to collect the grain for transporting back to Germany. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > The speech's patriotic appeal was all the more powerful because people were already beginning to learn the bitter realities of German occupation. Stories of the horrors of the prisoner-of-war camps mingled with eyewitness reports of the mass shooting of civilians and the burning of villages by German troops to produce in the still-retreating ranks of the Red Army a determination to fight the enemy that had been almost entirely absent in the first chaotic days of the war. When the city of Kursk fell, the Germans arrested all the healthy male inhabitants, penned them into open barbed-wire enclosures without food or water, and then put them to work, guarded by Germans wielding rubber truncheons. 'The streets are empty,' noted a Soviet intelligence report. 'The shops have been looted. There is no mains water and no electricity. Kursk has collapsed.'",

[linebreak]  [linebreak] So the baseline of what I understood is that she associates with EVERY woman displayed anywhere. So if a woman is stupid, shy or subserviant, she feels insulted. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And my point was: everyone is an individual, you are not all of those women. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And then she said that I should also feel bad if there is a stupid man in a movie, but I have no point to feel that way. I am not that guy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Originally all stick figures in the game were male and it was also perceived as that by many, so I decided to put in female stick figures as well. So her perception that they look genderless was not shared by most. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In Supraland there are a few dumb teeny fangirls admiring a suprastar. That was the worst moment for her. She says that all women in the game are weak. She ignored that the main woman, the queen, is more dominant than both of the kings and is showing them the way, and she is also ordering the player around. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So it seems that she wants all women to be strong and dominant. But the thing is, what hormons people run on is different from case to case. Depending on what happened to you in your life you run on different hormons. For example when a woman loses her man, she usually becomes more masculine to be able to survive and she becomes more feminine again when she gets a man again.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some women run on masculine hormones and are the tough ones. Many women are very feminine and enjoy being subserviant - and because of that nature they have no voice in public, because only dominant more masculine women are so extrovert to raise their voice. That is probably the reason for the disconnect between the media and the people. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Same thing for men - many men are more on the feminine side and soft and also have a hard time in this society with it. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And my point of view in general: let everyone be just the way they are and let them do whatever they want. Don't force feminine people into being masculine, don't force masculine people into being feminine. Everyone is an individual.",

While I'm sure that there are trans women in \"trap\" porn, often times they are male identifying who aim for a feminine look. In that case the setting of the porn itself is that they are men trying to \"trick\" men, so it's an accurate description. Finally, when it comes to anime/manga the characters are also male identifying, outside of the (extremely rare) series where characters are transexual, and in those those issues are often addressed.",

It's alright if you say the murderer acted like a yandere character would, I'd also say it's cool, albeit a bit cringy, if you're watching a movie or series where a character kills someone over jealously and you call that a yandere. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But in the context of real life with real people, unless you're making a dark joke, you shouldn't really be calling a murderer via an anime stereotype because it's innacurate. Yandere is a thing in anime because of the context the media is built. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In the same manner, traps don't mind being called traps because they don't exist, it doesn't help increase hate crime rate of anime characters if you address them by that term, and 'trap' has a use for anime community because it identifies characters that do not fall correctly under the trans nor crossdresser label. The problem is that anime culture reached out way outside it's bubble and people that have no idea what the term reffers to started using it wrongly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A trans person would be someone born in the wrong body, they feel the other gender and have the need to be more like the other gender. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A crossdresser is a person that is of a gender but likes dressing up as the other gender from time to time. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What the term trap tries to define are anime characters that dress up and act like another gender, and sometimes even go as far as saying they feel like the gender they're going by, but doesn't actually suffer from gender dysphoria. What makes this term not really useable for real people is the fact that you can never assume a person isn't suffering from gender dysphoria because *they* are the only ones able to tell what they're suffering from, as with a fictional character it's entirely alright to assume they aren't suffering from something if the narrative doesn't imply they are.

Fine, EdD, a professor of education at California State Polytechnic Institute in Pomona and editor of the \"Handbook on Animal-assisted Therapy: Foundations and Guidelines for Animal-assisted Interventions\" (2015)... [linebreak] >>But psychologists shouldn't write such letters cavalierly, say experts who have examined the issue. Because writing such letters could damage the therapeutic relationship, psychologists shouldn't write them for their own patients. And even forensic psychologists should tread carefully. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not all fantastic and there are difficulties. Universities in particular are almost never set up for animals and they are seeing a large increase of ESA requests.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] There's also the issue where you can basically just go online and get an order for one, without ever really meeting or seeing the person who writes you a letter. I've seen some sites require a \"quick phone call\" and some that don't even require that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Considering the benefits, I think ESAs are an overall great thing. Even though there are obstacles or issues that have come up, it's worth tackling them and trying to find solutions rather than abolish the program or hate them out of spite because some people abuse the program like the posters in the OP. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We can reduce \"ESA fraud\" if that's what we want to call it, but I think it's worth taking the effort to minimize harm to innocents while closing any loopholes or making changes to the program.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The university situation in particular is interesting. In a lot of dorms things are already cramped and diseases can spread quickly. It's not the healthiest space for humans physically, introducing animals into the situation seems like it could have big repercussions.
