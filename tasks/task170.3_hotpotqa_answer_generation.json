The version of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" in the \"Worcester Chronicle\" says that in 735 he succeeded Pehthelm, after the latter's death, as Bishop of Whithorn.  The only other source for Frithwald is the entry in versions D and E of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" which, \"sub anno\" 762, relate that:Frithwald, bishop at Whithorn, died on the Nones of May [May 7].  He was consecrated at Chester on the eighteenth before the Kalends of September [August 15], in the sixth winter of Ceolwulf's kingship [734/5]; and he was bishop twenty-nine winters<br>\"Fri\u00feuweald biscop \u00e6t Hwiterne for\u00f0ferde on Nonas Maius, se w\u00e6s gehalgod on Ceastre on . xviii.

Originally from Angeln, present-day Schleswig-Holstein, a legendary list of their kings has been preserved in the heroic poems \"Widsith\" and \"Beowulf\", and the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\".Context_3: The Dragon (Beowulf) The final act of the Anglo-Saxon poem \"Beowulf\" is about the hero Beowulf's fight with a dragon, the third monster he encounters in the epic.  On his return from Heorot, where he killed Grendel and Grendel's mother, Beowulf becomes king of the Geats and rules peacefully for fifty winters until a slave awakens and angers a dragon by stealing a jewelled cup from its lair in order to gain freedom from killing his brother.  When the angry dragon mercilessly burns the Geats' homes and lands, Beowulf decides to fight and kill the monster personally.  He and his thanes climb to the dragon's lair where, upon seeing the beast, the thanes flee in terror, leaving only Wiglaf to battle at Beowulf's side.  When the dragon wounds Beowulf fatally, Wiglaf slays it.Context_4: Battle of Brunanburh (poem) The Battle of Brunanburh is an Old English poem.  It is preserved in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", a historical record of events in Anglo-Saxon England which was kept from the late ninth to the mid-twelfth century.  The poem records the Battle of Brunanburh, a battle fought in 937 between an English army and a combined army of Scots, Vikings, and Britons.  The battle resulted in an English victory, celebrated by the poem in style and language like that of traditional Old English battle poetry.  The poem is notable because of those traditional elements and has been praised for its authentic tone, but it is also remarkable for its fiercely nationalistic tone, which documents the development of a unified England ruled by the House of Wessex.Context_5: Widsith Widsith is an Old English poem of 143 lines.  The poem survives only in the Exeter Book, a manuscript of Old English poetry compiled in the late 10th century containing approximately one sixth of all surviving Old English poetry.  Widsith is located between the poems \"Vainglory\" and \"The Fortunes of Men\".  Since the donation of the Exeter Book in 1076, it has been housed in Exeter Cathedral in southwest England.  The poem is for the most part a survey of the people, kings, and heroes of Europe in the Heroic Age of Northern Europe: see Tribes of Widsith.Context_6: Grendel Grendel is a being originated from the Anglo-Saxon epic poem \"Beowulf\" (AD 700\u20131000), which is considered to be the oldest surviving poem in Old English.  He is one of the poem's three antagonists (along with Grendel's mother and the dragon), all aligned in opposition against the protagonist Beowulf.  Grendel is feared by all but Beowulf.  Grendel is described to have descended from the lineage of the Biblical figure Cain, from Genesis 4 of the Bible, and is usually depicted as a monster or a giant, although his status as a monster, giant or some other form of supernatural being is not clearly described in the poem and thus remains the subject of scholarly debate.Context_7: Nowell Codex The Nowell Codex is the second of two manuscripts found in the bound volume Cotton Vitellius A.xv, one of the four major Anglo-Saxon poetic manuscripts.  It is most famous as the manuscript containing the unique copy of the epic poem \"Beowulf\".  In addition to this, it contains first a fragment of \"The Life of Saint Christopher\", then the more complete texts \"Wonders of the East\" and \"Letters of Alexander to Aristotle,\" and, after \"Beowulf\", a poetic translation of \"Judith\".  Due to the fame of \"Beowulf\", the Nowell codex is also sometimes known simply as the Beowulf manuscript.  The manuscript is located within the British Library with the rest of the Cotton collection.Context_8: Offa of Angel Offa is a legendary king of the Angles in the genealogy of the kings of Mercia presented in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\".

The first Anglo-Saxon settlers, the Magons\u00e6tan, were a sub-tribal unit of the Hwicce who occupied the Severn valley.  The Magons\u00e6tan were said to be in the intervening lands between the Rivers Wye and Severn.  The undulating hills of marl clay were surrounded by the Welsh mountains to the west; the Malvern Hills to the east; the Clent Hills of the Shropshire borders to the north, and the indeterminate extent of the Forest of Dean to the south.  The shire name first recorded in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" was derived from \"Here-ford\", Old English for \"Army crossing\", the location for the city.  The area was covered first by Offa of Mercia, who constructed the dyke as a boundary to keep warring tribes out of the Mercian kingdom: an early indication of the ambivalent relations with the Welsh.  The shire as an administrative unit was developed from Alfred the Great's Burghal Hidage, and the Shire-reeve courts of the Hundred.  King Edgar the \u00c6theling was a regular visitor, and founded the diocese, previously part of the see of Worcester, in 976.  The establishment of a centre of law and justice was supported by a monastic chapter that flourished during the Tenth century Reformation.  Hereford's geographical location at the hub of the shire allowed Anglo-Saxon ealdormen to manage affairs; and Hereford played a vital role in the Scandinavian wars until Ralph, Earl Hereford was deposed by the regal Earl Harold Godwinson.Context_10: Layamon's Brut Layamon's \"Brut (ca. 1190 - 1215), also known as The Chronicle of Britain\", is a Middle English poem compiled and recast by the English priest Layamon.  The \"Brut\" is 16,095 lines long and narrates the history of Britain: it is the first historiography written in English since the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\".  Named for Britain's mythical founder, Brutus of Troy, the poem is largely based on the Anglo-Norman \"Roman de Brut\" by Wace, which is in turn a version of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Latin \"Historia Regum Britanniae\".  Layamon's poem, however, is longer than both and includes an enlarged section on the life and exploits of King Arthur.  It is written in the alliterative verse style commonly used in Middle English poetry by rhyming chroniclers, the two halves of the alliterative lines being often linked by rhyme as well as by alliteration.Fact_1: Kings of the AnglesFact_2: Kings of the AnglesFact_3: WidsithFact_4: WidsithQuestion: What book contains a poem which, along with \"Beowulf\" and the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", preserves a legendary list of the kings of the Angles?", "output": ["Exeter Book"]}, {"input": "Context_1: Karl Freiherr von M\u00fcffling Friedrich Karl Ferdinand Freiherr von M\u00fcffling, called Weiss (12 June 177510 January 1851) was a Prussian \"Generalfeldmarschall\" and military theorist.

Pure stands of Dinaric calcareous Silver fir \u2014\"Abies alba\" forests appear on limestone escarpments in the montane zones of Orjen, Velebit, Biokovo and Prenj.  They comprise one of the most interesting formations of Balkan vegetation types as the forests bear several rare plants and are of striking beauty.  As a highly endemic and rare vegetation type of the Dinarids it needs protection.Context_2: Kniphofia Kniphofia , also called tritoma, red hot poker, torch lily, knofflers or poker plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asphodelaceae, first described as a genus in 1794.  It is native to Africa.  Herbaceous species and hybrids have narrow, grass-like leaves 10 - long, while perennial species have broader, strap-shaped foliage up to 1.5 m long.  All plants produce spikes of upright, brightly coloured flowers well above the foliage, in shades of red, orange and yellow, often bicoloured.  The flowers produce copious nectar while blooming and are attractive to bees.  In the New World they may attract sap-suckers such as hummingbirds and New World orioles.Context_3: Caatinga Caatinga (] ) is a type of desert vegetation, which can also be called Jola Jolilo (Jou-lah-Jouh-Liloy).  It is the indian name for the Caatinga, and an ecoregion characterized by this vegetation in interior northeastern Brazil.  The name \"Caatinga\" is a Tupi word meaning \"white forest\" or \"white vegetation\" (\"caa\" = forest, vegetation, \"tinga\" = white).Context_4: Lourensford Alluvium Fynbos Lourensford Alluvium Fynbos is a critically endangered vegetation type that is endemic to Cape Town.  Though closest to Fynbos, it has characteristics of both Fynbos and Renosterveld vegetation and is thus actually a unique hybrid vegetation type.Context_5: Desert dry wash Desert dry wash is a North American desert vegetation type (or biome) occurring in the flat bottoms of canyons and drainages that lack water at or near the surface most of the year, and are subject to periodic severe flooding events.  Desert dry wash is contrasted with desert riparian vegetation, which occurs in desert canyons and drainages where there is year-round water at or near the surface.  Plants must either be able to survive the severe flooding conditions or be able to reestablish themselves before the next flooding event.  Some of these plants have evolved so that in order for their seeds to germinate, the seeds must be scarified or abraded by tumbling sand, gravel, and rocks during the flooding event.  They must then quickly send down roots deep enough to be able to tap into deep underground water reserves, in order to survive the dry period after the flooding.  Common dominant species of the desert dry wash include smoke tree (\"Psorothamnus spinosus\"), desert willow (\"Chilopsis linearis\"), catclaw (\"Senegalia greggii\"), cheesebush (\"Ambrosia salsola\"), and waterweed (\"Baccharis sergiloides\").Context_6: Baptisia Baptisia (wild indigo, false indigo) is a genus in the legume family, Fabaceae.  They are flowering herbaceous perennial plants with pea-like flowers, followed by pods, which are sometimes inflated.  They are native to woodland and grassland in eastern and southern North America.  The species most commonly found in cultivation is \"B. australis\".Context_7: Desert riparian Desert riparian is a North American desert vegetation type (or biome) occurring in the bottoms of canyons and drainages that have water at or near the surface most of the year.  It is contrasted with the desert dry wash vegetation type in which water at or near the surface is lacking most of the year.  The visual character is of large, lush green trees surrounded by dry desert vegetation and soil coloration.  The area may be in a patch surrounding a spring (oasis), or in a strand following the course of water flow.  Over 80% of known desert wildlife species use desert riparian areas.  Common dominant species include Fremont cottonwood (\"Populus fremontii\"), Arizona ash (\"Fraxinus velutina\"), arroyo willow (\"Salix lasiolepis\"), Goodding's willow (\"Salix gooddingii\"), red willow (\"Salix laevigata\"), California fan palm (\"Washingtonia filifera\"), and invasive species such as salt cedar (\"Tamarix ramosissima\"), giant reed (\"Arundo donax\"), and Russian olive (\"Elaeagnus angustifolia\").  Salt cedar is particularly causing problems for this ecosystem because it is able to extract water more efficiently than cottonwoods and willows.  Many noninvasive non-native species may also be found because springs and surface water areas in the desert often were old homesites where such species were intentionally planted, such as elm, black locust, and assorted fruit trees.Context_8: Vegetation and slope stability Vegetation and slope stability are interrelated by the ability of the plant life growing on slopes to both promote and hinder the stability of the slope.  The relationship is a complex combination of the type of soil, the rainfall regime, the plant species present, the slope aspect, and the steepness of the slope.  Knowledge of the underlying slope stability as a function of the soil type, its age, horizon development, compaction, and other impacts is a major underlying aspect of understanding how vegetation can alter the stability of the slope.  There are four major ways in which vegetation influences slope stability: wind throwing, the removal of water, mass of vegetation (surcharge), and mechanical reinforcement of roots.Context_9: Vegetation classification Vegetation classification is the process of classifying and mapping the vegetation over an area of the earth's surface.  Vegetation classification is often performed by state based agencies as part of land use, resource and environmental management.  Many different methods of vegetation classification have been used.  In general, there has been a shift from structural classification used by forestry for the mapping of timber resources, to floristic community mapping for biodiversity management.  Whereas older forestry-based schemes considered factors such as height, species and density of the woody canopy, floristic community mapping shifts the emphasis onto ecological factors such as climate, soil type and floristic associations.  Classification mapping is usually now done using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software.Context_10: Wildfire A wildfire or wildland fire is a fire in an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area.  Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire.  Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago.  Wildfire\u2019s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.  Earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich vegetation, seasonally dry climates, atmospheric oxygen, and widespread lightning and volcano ignitions.Fact_1: KniphofiaFact_2: BaptisiaQuestion: What type of vegetation does Kniphofia and Baptisia have in common?", "output": ["plant"]}, {"input": "Context_1: My Own Worst Enemy (song) \"My Own Worst Enemy\" is a song by the American rock band Lit.

Veritas is chiefly remembered as a manufacturer of sports cars and successful Formula Two racing cars.  The company closed when its founder, Ernst Loof, became ill.  He subsequently died in 1956.  The Klenk-Meteor entered for the 1954 German Grand Prix was essentially a Veritas Formula Two car.  The car was owned and prepared by the noted German racing driver Hans Klenk who intended to race it himself in the Grand Prix.  However, Klenk's career as a racing driver came to an end when he suffered injuries in an accident while working as a test driver for Mercedes-Benz.  The car was driven in the Grand Prix by another German, Theo Helfrich.  He retired on lap 9 with engine failure.Context_6: Racing helmet A racing helmet is a form of protective headgear worn by racing car and rally drivers.  Motor racing has long been known to be an exceptionally risky sport: sudden deceleration forces on the head can easily occur if a racing car loses control at the very high speeds of competitive motor racing or the rough terrain experienced in rallying.  A risk more nearly unique to motor racing is the possibility of drastically severe burns from fuel igniting when the fuel lines or fuel tank of the vehicle are jolted sufficiently to dislodge or breach them in a situation in which the driver cannot soon enough escape from his car.  This happened to world champion driver Niki Lauda at the 1976 German Grand Prix race at the N\u00fcrburgring in a crash from which he barely escaped alive.Context_7: James Hunt James Simon Wallis Hunt (29 August 1947 \u2013 15 June 1993) was a British racing driver who won the Formula One World Championship in .

Articles in scientific journals are mostly written by active scientists such as students, researchers and professors instead of professional journalists.  There are thousands of scientific journals in publication, and many more have been published at various points in the past (see list of scientific journals).  Most journals are highly specialized, although some of the oldest journals such as \"Nature\" publish articles and scientific papers across a wide range of scientific fields.  Scientific journals contain articles that have been peer reviewed, in an attempt to ensure that articles meet the journal's standards of quality, and scientific validity.  Although scientific journals are superficially similar to professional magazines, they are actually quite different.  Issues of a scientific journal are rarely read casually, as one would read a magazine.  The publication of the results of research is an essential part of the scientific method.  If they are describing experiments or calculations, they must supply enough details that an independent researcher could repeat the experiment or calculation to verify the results.  Each such journal article becomes part of the permanent scientific record.Fact_1: Teri W. OdomFact_2: Teri W. OdomFact_3: ACS NanoQuestion:  Teri W.

The US immediately responded by declaring war on Germany and Italy, thus thrusting the United States in fighting two major fronts across the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans in World War II.Context_5: Tijuana Cartel The Tijuana Cartel (Spanish: \"C\u00e1rtel de Tijuana\") or Arellano-F\u00e9lix Organization (Spanish: \"C\u00e1rtel Arellano F\u00e9lix - CAF\") is a Mexican drug cartel based in Tijuana.  The cartel once was described as \"one of the biggest and most violent criminal groups in Mexico.\"  However, since the 2006 Sinaloa Cartel incursion in Baja California and the fall of the Arellano-F\u00e9lix brothers, the Tijuana Cartel had been reduced to few cells.  In 2016, the organization has become known as Cartel Tijuana Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (New Generation Tijuana Cartel) and has begun to aligin itself under the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, along with Beltr\u00e1n Leyva Organization (BLO) to create an anti-Sinaloa alliance, in which the Jalisco New Generation Cartel heads, creating a possible powershift in Mexico.Context_6: Ju\u00e1rez Cartel The Ju\u00e1rez Cartel (Spanish: \"C\u00e1rtel de Ju\u00e1rez\"), also known as the Vicente Carrillo Fuentes Organization, is a Mexican drug cartel based in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua, across the U.S.-Mexico border from El Paso, Texas.  The cartel is one of several drug trafficking organizations that have been known to decapitate their rivals, mutilate their corpses and dump them in public places to instill fear not only into the general public, but also into local law enforcement and their rivals, the Sinaloa Cartel.  The Ju\u00e1rez Cartel has an armed wing known as La L\u00ednea, a Juarez street gang that usually performs the executions.  It also uses the Barrio Azteca gang to attack its enemies.Context_7: Undeclared war An undeclared war is a military conflict between two or more nations without either side issuing a formal declaration of war.  The term is sometimes used to include any disagreement or conflict fought about without an official declaration.  Since the United Nations \"police action\" in Korea followed the example set by the United Kingdom during the so-called Malaysian Emergency, a number of democratic governments have pursued disciplinary actions and limited warfare by characterizing them as something else, such as a \"military action\" or \"armed response\".  The United States has not formally declared war since World War II.  Most notably, the United States never officially declared war during its more than decade-long involvement in Vietnam; the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution authorized the escalation of the Vietnam War without a declaration of war.  Nations such as France, which had extensive colonies in which its military provided order, continued to intervene in their former colonies' affairs as police actions.Context_8: Independent Cartel of Acapulco The Independent Cartel of Guerrero (Spanish: C\u00e1rtel Independiente de Acapulco or CIDA) was a criminal gang based in the Mexican resort city of Acapulco, Guerrero and its surrounding territories.  The criminal group came into existence during the rapid decentralization of Mexico's drug trafficking organizations and as a split-off group of the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva Cartel.  Originally, the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva cartel operated in the city, but the group no longer has presence in Acapulco.  After the Mexican military gunned down the top boss of the cartel \u2013 Arturo Beltr\u00e1n Leyva \u2013 in December 2009, his brother H\u00e9ctor Beltr\u00e1n Leyva took control of one of the factions of the cartel and declared war on Edgar Valdez Villarreal, who had long been the right hand of Arturo.  Amidst the violence, Valdez Villarreal tried to appoint a successor, but those in Acapulco broke off and formed their own criminal gang: the Independent Cartel of Acapulco.  Within weeks, however, the group had splittered too, forming a new and rival group known as La Barredora.  Villarreal Valdez was then captured by the Mexican Federal Police in August 2010, but the violence between the groups for the control of Acapulco continued.Context_9: Murder of Lea Mek Lea Mek ( \u20091975 \u2013 December 3, 1993) was a Cambodian refugee living in the United States who was a member of the Asian Boyz street gang.  On December 3, 1993, Mek was murdered in a gang shooting by the Wah Ching gang, at a pool hall in El Monte, California.  The murder was caught on camera by four surveillance cameras installed within the hall.  After the murder, the Asian Boyz declared war on the Wah Ching.  As a result, it influenced a number of other gang murders and shootings in the LA area, and created a strong feud between both Asian gangs.  Authorities claim the murder inspired a chain reaction of gang violence which led to ten other murders in the LA area.Context_10: Knights Templar Cartel Knights Templar\u2014Guard of Michoac\u00e1n (Spanish: \"Los Caballeros Templarios Guardia Michoacana\") commonly known as the Knights Templar Cartel (Spanish: \"Los Caballeros Templarios\") is a Mexican criminal organization composed of remnants of the defunct La Familia Michoacana drug cartel based in the Mexican State of Michoac\u00e1n.Fact_1: La BarredoraFact_2: Edgar Valdez VillarrealQuestion: La Barredora was a gang that declared war on the leader of the cartel based where?", "output": ["Sinaloa"]}, {"input": "Context_1: Alternative Vote Plus The Alternative Vote Plus (AV+), or Alternative Vote Top-up, is a semi-proportional voting system.

On April 7, 1953 President Dwight D. Eisenhower requested that Congress extend for one year the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, a measure which had originally been passed in 1934.  Under this act and its subsequent extensions, the President was authorized to negotiate agreements with other countries for tariff reduction.  In his message of April 7, the President called for a commission to study U.S. foreign economic policy in general.  Section 301 of this Act provided for a bipartisan commission which consisted of seventeen members: seven appointed by the President, five appointed from the Senate by the Vice President, and five from the United States House of Representatives by the Speaker.  President Eisenhower appointed Clarence B. Randall, Chairman of the Board of Inland Steel Company, as Chairman of the Commission.  The Commission was directed to examine and report on the subjects of international trade, foreign economic policy, and the trade aspects of national security and total foreign policy.  It was to recommend appropriate policies, measures, and practices, based on its findings, in a report to Congress.Context_3: Robert Nyce Robert E.

The commission was the fourth of seven conservation commissions and conferences established during Roosevelt's presidency (1901-1909).  This commission had resulted from the first Conference of Governors just weeks earlier, which similarly had stemmed from the previous recommendations of the Inland Waterways Commission, presented to Congress in February 1908.  The National Conservation Commission was divided into four sections, water, forests, lands, and minerals, with each having its own chairman; it prepared the first inventory of the nation's natural resources, in a three-volume report submitted to Congress at the beginning of 1909.  The commissions findings also present Pinchot's concepts of resource management as a comprehensive policy recommendation for the government.  Roosevelt and Pinchot wanted the Commission to continue, but Congress refused further funding.Context_7: Kothari Commission Indian Education Commission (1964-1966), popularly known as Kothari Commission, was an ad hoc commission set up by the Government of India to examine all aspects of the educational sector in India, to evolve a general pattern of education and to advise guidelines and policies for the development of education in India.

It was released in a four-disc 10-inch 78-rpm record box, in both a two-disc 7-inch 45-rpm extended-play foldout album and a four-disc 45-rpm regular-play box and on a 10-inch 33\u2153-rpm album.  The serial number, 222, coincidentally included James's lucky number, \"22,\" which appeared in many of her record serial numbers all over the world.  The album is the first to present its songs as a book in music, opening with \"Let There Be Love\" and closing with \"I'll Be Seeing You\", with the songs telling a story start to finish.  The memorable cover was done at M-G-M Pictures Studios in Culver City by artist Russ Gale.  From the album a single of \"Let There Be Love\" and \"You're Nearer\" was shipped to radio stations.  Then, by public demand, a single of \"You're My Everything\" and \"You're Nearer\" was released.  This album offered Joni's second recording of \"Let There Be Love,\" which had been released in an earlier version in 1952 as her first single on Sharp Records in Chicago, then going to M-G-M Records for further distribution.  Both recordings were arranged and conducted by Lew Douglas.  \"Let There Be Love\" went to the top of the album charts and was the sixth-best-selling album of 1953.  In 1956 the album was reissued as a 12-inch L.P. and in three single EPs; there was no EP set including the entire album.  For this release, four Joni James singles were added, but one of them had never been released.  That was \"I Need You Now,\" which was to have followed the hit \"My Love, My Love\" but was canceled when Eddie Fisher came out with a version recorded several weeks after Joni's.  M-G-M had expected Joni's original version to go straight to #1.  For the new album the first four songs and second four songs were switched to get \"You're My Everything\" in the outside groove of the L.P. to facilitate disc jockey play.  So, for 50 years, the story the album tells has been garbled.  In 1961 the album got new cover art, a new serial number (E3931), and an electronically simulated stereo release.  Released again on compact disk with yet more bonus tracks, the album is in its fifth decade as a best seller.  Joni James hopes for yet another release which will restore the original song order.  Significantly, for her last M-G-M album, \"Bossa Nova Style\", Joni included new recordings of several songs from \"Let There Be Love\", including a new single of \"You're Nearer.\"  That album was arranged by Lew Douglas's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Chuck Sagle.

TDS operation is based on time frames (TFs) that can be viewed as virtual containers for multiple IP packets that are switched at every TDS switch based on and coordinated by the UTC (coordinated universal time) signal implementing pipeline forwarding.  In the context of optical networks, synchronous virtual pipes SVPs typical of pipeline forwarding are called fractional lambda pipes (F\u03bbPs).Context_3: Civil time In modern usage, civil time refers to statutory time scales designated by civilian authorities, or to local time indicated by clocks.  Modern civil time is generally standard time in a time zone at a fixed offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), possibly adjusted by daylight saving time during part of the year.  UTC is calculated by reference to atomic clocks, and was adopted in 1972.  Older systems use telescope observations.Context_4: Mountain Time Zone The Mountain Time Zone of North America keeps time by subtracting seven hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when standard time is in effect, and by subtracting six hours during daylight saving time (UTC\u22126).  The clock time in this zone is based on the mean solar time at the 105th meridian west of the Greenwich Observatory.  In the United States, the exact specification for the location of time zones and the dividing lines between zones is set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations at 49 CFR 71.Context_5: Time in Malaysia Malaysia Standard Time (MST; Malay: \"Waktu Piawai Malaysia\" , WPM ) or Malaysia Time (MYT) is a standard time used in Malaysia.  It is 8 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time and Coordinated Universal Time.  The local mean time in Kuala Lumpur was originally .  Peninsular Malaysia used this local mean time until 1880, when they changed to Singapore mean time .  Between the end of the Second World War and the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963, it was known as British Malayan Standard Time, which was hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time.  At 2330 hrs local time of 31 December 1981, people in Peninsular Malaysia adjusted their clocks and watches ahead by 30 minutes to become 00:00 hours local time of 1 January 1982, to match the time in use in East Malaysia, which is .  SGT (Singapore) as follow on the same until now.Context_6: Deal Timeball Deal Timeball is a Victorian maritime Greenwich Mean Time signal located on the roof of a waterfront four-storey tower in the coastal town of Deal, in Kent, England.  It was established in 1855 by the Astronomer Royal George Biddell Airy in collaboration with Charles V. Walker, superintendent of telegraphs for the South Eastern Railway Company.  It was built by the Lambeth firm of engineers Maudslay and Field.  The time ball, which, like the Greenwich time ball, fell at 1 pm precisely, was triggered by an electric signal directly from the Royal Observatory.Context_7: DUT1 The time correction DUT1 (sometimes also written DUT) is the difference between Universal Time (UT1), which is defined by Earth's rotation, and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is defined by a network of precision atomic clocks.Context_8: Day A day is a unit of time.  In common usage, it is either an interval equal to 24 hours or daytime, the consecutive period of time during which the Sun is above the horizon.  The period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation with respect to the Sun is called a \"solar day\".  Several definitions of this universal human concept are used according to context, need and convenience.  In 1960, the second was redefined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth, and was designated the SI base unit of time.  The unit of measurement \"day\", redefined in 1960 as 86 400 SI seconds and symbolized \"d\", is not an SI unit, but is accepted for use with SI.  A civil day is usually 86 400 seconds, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time.  The word \"day\" may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, \"On which day?\"  The life patterns of humans and many other species are related to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle (see circadian rhythms).Context_9: Universal Time Universal Time (UT) is a time standard based on Earth's rotation.  It is a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), i.e., the mean solar time on the Prime Meridian at Greenwich, London, UK.  In fact, the expression \"Universal Time\" is ambiguous (when accuracy of better than a few seconds is required), as there are several versions of it, the most commonly used being Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and UT1 (see below).  All of these versions of UT, except for UTC, are based on Earth's rotation relative to distant celestial objects (stars and quasars), but with a scaling factor and other adjustments to make them closer to solar time.  UTC is based on International Atomic Time, with leap seconds added to keep it within 0.9 second of UT1.Context_10: Central European Time Central European Time (CET), used in most parts of Europe and a few North African countries, is a standard time which is 1\u00a0hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  The time offset from UTC can be written as .  The same standard time, , is also known as Middle European Time (MET, German: ) and under other names like Berlin Time, Romance Standard Time (RST), Paris Time or Rome Time.Fact_1: Deal TimeballFact_2: Greenwich Mean TimeQuestion: Up to how far off can the Deal Timeball be from Coordinated Universal Time?", "output": ["0.9 s."]}, {"input": "Context_1: Emo Emo is a genre of rock music characterized by an emphasis on emotional expression, sometimes through confessional lyrics.  It emerged as a style of post-hardcore from the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement of Washington, D.C., where it was known as emotional hardcore or emocore and pioneered by Washington, D.C. hardcore bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace.  However, as the genre was taken up by a new generation of musicians in the early 1990s, its sound and meaning shifted and changed and it was reinvented as a style of indie rock and pop punk by bands such as Jawbreaker, Sunny Day Real Estate, Weezer, and Jimmy Eat World.  By the mid-1990s, numerous emo acts such as Braid, The Promise Ring, and the Get Up Kids emerged in the Midwestern and Central United States, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the genre.  Meanwhile, a more aggressive style of emo, screamo, had also emerged, pioneered by the San Diego bands Heroin and Antioch Arrow.Context_2: Die anderen Bands Die anderen Bands (] , \"the other bands\") is a term combining alternative music bands of 1980s GDR (East Germany).  They shared a more or less open criticism of their country's political system, and a high degree of creativity which was lacking from the more established music scene of East Germany.

Built in a Victorian rectory it was originally an analogue studio used by unsigned bands and fading stars of Manchester's rich musical scene including ex-members of The Smiths and The Stone Roses.  In 2001 it installed a Pro Tools system, and then recorded albums for bands such as Amplifier, Oceansize, Inertia Blooms and Performance.  In 2005 there was a bizarre 3 a.m. appearance by U.S. rap star Snoop Dogg who visited the studio after playing a concert, bringing an entourage of musicians, enormous bodyguards and a chef.  The studio also branched out into making music videos.  In 2007 \"Super Producer\" Timbaland used the studio whilst on tour with Justin Timberlake.Context_6: Morbid Angel Morbid Angel is an American death metal band based in Tampa, Florida formed in 1983 by guitarist and sole remaining original member Trey Azagthoth, original vocalist and bassist Dallas Ward, and original drummer Mike Browning.  Widely considered as one of the most influential bands in the genre and important in the transition of death metal from its thrash metal roots, they were one of the first bands to incorporate guttural vocals, up-tempo blast beats, atonality in guitar playing, multiple tempo changes and dark atmosphere.  They have been described as one of \"the most influential and emulated bands in death metal\", alongside Cannibal Corpse, and have been cited as an influence by many later bands.  They were also the first death metal band to experience mainstream success in connection with being signed to Giant Records in 1992, heavy rotation of their music videos on MTV, and having the music video for the song \"God of Emptiness\" shown on an episode of \"Beavis and Butt-head\".  Their first four albums are considered classics in the genre.Context_7: Superheaven Superheaven (formerly known as Daylight) is an American alternative rock band from Doylestown, Pennsylvania, formed in 2008.

As the name suggests, the genre is a fusion of heavy metal and Celtic rock.  The early pioneers of the genre were the Irish bands Cruachan, Primordial and Waylander.  The genre has since expanded beyond Irish shores and is known to be performed today by bands from numerous other countries.Context_10: Stoner rock Stoner rock or stoner metal is a rock music fusion genre that combines elements of heavy metal and/or doom metal with psychedelic rock and acid rock.  The name references cannabis consumption.  The term desert rock is often used interchangeably with the term \"stoner rock\" to describe this genre; however, not all stoner rock bands would fall under the descriptor of \"desert rock\".  Stoner rock is typically slow-to-mid tempo and features a heavily distorted, groove laden bass-heavy sound, melodic vocals, and \"retro\" production.

It was first published in paperback in September 2009 by Penguin Books in its Penguin Modern Classics series.Context_2: Conan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of Robert E. Howard's Conan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of, or simply Conan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of, is a sword and sorcery British pen-and-paper role-playing game set in the world of Conan the Barbarian, the fictional Hyborian Age.  Both the character and the setting were first imagined by American author Robert E. Howard (1906-1936) as of 1932 and until his suicide in 1936.  Howard's original literary work has since spawned a vast franchise of novels, comic books, films, video games, board games, role-playing games, etc.  Following this tradition, \"Conan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of\" is the third officially licensed Conan role-playing game.  The two precedent games were \"Conan Role-Playing Game\" (1985-1988) and \"\" (2004-2010), although there also had been supplements for independent generic systems, like \"GURPS Conan\" (1988-1989).Context_3: Valeria (Conan the Barbarian) Valeria is a pirate and adventuress (a member of \"The Red Brotherhood\" of pirates) in the fictional universe of Robert E.

Traditionally, the field of optometry began with the primary focus of correcting refractive error through the use of spectacles.  Modern day optometry, however, has evolved through time so that the education curriculum additionally includes intensive medical training in the diagnosis and management of ocular disease in countries where the profession is established and regulated.  Optometrists (also known as Doctors of Optometry in the US and Canada for those holding the O.D. degree or Ophthalmic Opticians in the UK) are medical professionals who provide primary eyecare through comprehensive eye examinations to detect and treat various visual abnormalities and eye diseases.  Being a regulated profession, an optometrist's scope of practice may differ depending on the location.  Thus, disorders or diseases detected outside the treatment scope of optometry are referred out to relevant medical professionals for proper care, more commonly to ophthalmologists who are physicians that specialize in tertiary medical and surgical care of the eye.  Optometrists typically work closely together with other eye care professionals such as ophthalmologists and opticians to deliver quality and efficient eyecare to the general public.Context_5: Lee Family Digital Archive The Lee Family Digital Archive is a scholarly effort to collect, edit, and disseminate the papers of the Lee family of Virginia.

Howard Robert E. Howard's legacy extended after his death in 1936.  Howard's most famous character, Conan the Barbarian, has a pop-culture imprint that has been compared to such icons as Tarzan of the Apes, Count Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, and James Bond.  Howard's critical reputation suffered at first but over the decades works of Howard scholarship have been published.  The first professionally published example of this was L. Sprague de Camp's \"Dark Valley Destiny\" (1983) which was followed by other works, including Don Herron's \"The Dark Barbarian\" (1984) and Mark Finn's \"\" (2006).  Also in 2006, a charity, Robert E. Howard Foundation, was created to promote further scholarship.Context_8: Robert E.

Howard\" in the introductory credits.Context_10: National Association for Chiropractic Medicine The National Association for Chiropractic Medicine (NACM) was a minority chiropractic association founded in 1984 that described itself as a \"consumer advocacy association of chiropractors\".  It openly rejected some of the more controversial aspects of chiropractic, including a basic concept of chiropractic, vertebral subluxations as the cause of all diseases.  It also sought to \"reform the chiropractic profession away from a philosophical scope of practice and towards an applied science scope of practice.\"  It stated that it was \"dedicated to bringing the scientific based practice of chiropractic into mainstream medicine\" and that its members \"confine their scope of practice to scientific parameters and seek to make legitimate the utilization of professional manipulative procedures in mainstream health care delivery.\"  \"While the NACM is focused on furthering the profession, its primary focus is on the rights and safety of the consumers.\"  The NACM was the object of much controversy and criticism from the rest of the profession.

The helicopter has a maximum takeoff weight in the range of 10 tons, can drop troops at locations of up to 3,000 ft altitude, and could operate from the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning.  It is thought to be comparable to the US made Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, the civilian Sikorsky S-70C-2 variant of which has been used by the People's Liberation Army since 1984.  Some sources suggest that the Z-20 is a copy of the Black Hawk and link the design to the Black Hawk that was abandoned by US special forces in Pakistan during the operation to kill Osama bin Laden on 1 May 2011.  The sources say that Pakistan allowed Chinese officials to examine the Black Hawk wreckage.  However, Aviation Week also points out that although some aspects of the design do appear similar, such as the tail wheel arrangement, there are also marked differences.  For example, the Chinese Z-20 has a five blade rotor compared with the Black Hawks' four blades.Context_4: Kawasaki KH-4 The Kawasaki KH-4 was a light utility helicopter produced in Japan in the 1960s as a development of the Bell 47 that Kawasaki had been building under licence since 1952.

Some 10,000 of the \"disappeared\" were guerrillas of the Montoneros (MPM) and the Marxist People's Revolutionary Army (ERP) although the lowest estimate is that the Montoneros and ERP had a combined strength of 5,000.  The \"disappeared\" included those thought to be a political or ideological threat to the military junta, even vaguely, and they were killed in an attempt by the junta to silence the opposition and break the determination of the guerrillas.  The worst repression reportedly occurred after the guerillas were largely defeated in 1977, when the church, labor unions, artists, intellectuals and university students and professors were targeted.  Although the Montoneros reported having carried out some 600 armed attacks in 1977, the guerrilla threat had greatly declined.  The junta justified this mass terror by exaggerating the guerrilla threat, and even staged attacks to be blamed on guerillas and used frozen dead bodies of guerilla fighters that had been kept in storage for this purpose.  In late 1979, Amnesty International accused the Videla military government of being responsible for the disappearance of 15,000 to 20,000 Argentine citizens since the 1976 coup.  That year, a special study by the New York City Bar concluded that around 10,000 Argentines had disappeared since the coup.

The company played an important role in British Suffragette movement, both through its publication of feminist tracts and in providing employment opportunities for women in a field that had previously been restricted to men.  The house was set up to allow women to learn the trade of printing, and provided an apprenticeship program.  Women worked as compositors, and as of 1904, it was one of the few houses where they also did the imposing: ordering the galley proofs so that when folded, the front and back pages aligned properly.  As of 1899, the company employed 22 women as compositors.  The manager, proof-reader and bookkeeper were also women.  Men held the tasks of \"pressmen and feeders\".

The type species is \"S. syrticus\" of late Miocene Africa, which reached roughly 4 m (13.1 ft) in shoulder height.  The other unequivocally recognized species is \"S. orbus\", also of late Miocene Africa.  Other species outside of Africa are questionably placed in this genus, including teeth from Late Miocene Hungary and Iran originally described as being of the \"Mastodon\" subgenus \"Bunolophodon\", Chinese specimens originally described as being also of \"Mastodon\", as well as of \"Tetralophodon\" and \"Stegodon\", and a species from the late Miocene-aged Dokh Pathan Formation in Pakistan, \"S. maluvalensis\".Context_2: Volvopluteus michiganensis Volvopluteus michiganensis is a species of mushroom in the family Pluteaceae.  It was originally described under the name \"Pluteus michiganensis\" but molecular studies have placed it in the \"Volvopluteus\", a genus described in 2011.  The cap of this mushroom is about 7 \u2013 in diameter, gray, and has a cracked margin that is sticky when fresh.  The gills start out as white but they soon turn pink.  The stipe is white and has a volva at the base.  Microscopical features and DNA sequence data are of great importance for separating this taxon from related species.  \"V.\u00a0michiganensis\" is a saprotrophic fungus that was originally described as growing on sawdust.  It has only been reported from Michigan (USA) and the Dominican Republic.Context_3: Jurodidae The beetle family Jurodidae was originally described from fossils, but in 1996, a single species from the Russian Far East, described as Sikhotealinia zhiltzovae, was found and later was recognized to be a living representative of this otherwise extinct family (a \"living fossil\").  Since then, this beetle, known from only a single specimen, has been the source of contention, as it is reported to possess three ocelli on its forehead, a condition otherwise unknown in the entire order Coleoptera, whether extinct or living - though it is common in other orders, and generally considered a groundplan character for neopteran insects.  If true, this species may represent the most archaic of all living beetles.  However, other authorities have challenged this interpretation, and have further suggested that this beetle does not even belong to the Archostemata.  This may not be possible to resolve until additional specimens are collected, allowing for genetic analysis.Context_4: Agonum fuliginosum Agonum fuliginosum is a species of ground beetle in the Platyninae family.  It was described by Panzer in 1809 and can be found everywhere in Europe except for Albania, Andorra, Monaco, Portugal, San Marino, Vatican City and various European islands.Context_5: Selatosomus aeneus Selatosomus aeneus is a species of click beetle found in Europe.

It was originally described by Finnish mycologist Ilkka Kyt\u00f6vuori in 1999, as one of six species in the \"\"Stropharia semiglobata\"\" group in northwestern Europe.  The fungus produces fruit bodies on moose [known in Europe as European elk] dung.  In 2013, the fungus named after \"Alces alces\" was transferred by Redhead et al. to \"Protostropharia\", a genus circumscribed to contain \"Stropharia\" species characterized by the formation of astrocystidia rather than acanthocytes on their mycelium.  In addition to Europe, the species has also been recorded in Brazil.  The variety \"austrobrasiliensis\" was described from Rio Grande do Sul in 2008, where it grows on cow dung, or dung-enriched soil.Context_7: Cicindela albissima Cicindela albissima, commonly called the Coral Pink Sand Dunes tiger beetle is a species of tiger beetle endemic to Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park in southern Utah, United States.  It was originally described by Rumpp in 1962 as the subspecies \"Cicindela limbata albissima\", but mitochondrial DNA, along with the species' morphological and geographical distinctiveness, have shown that it is a separate species.  \"C. albissima\" can be distinguished from other \"Cicindela\" species by its restricted range and lack of pigmentation on its elytra.Context_8: Bark beetle A bark beetle is one of about 220 genera with 6,000 species of beetles in the subfamily Scolytinae.  Traditionally, this was considered a distinct family Scolytidae, but is now understood to be very specialized members of the \"true weevil\" family (Curculionidae).  Well-known species are members of the type genus \"Scolytus\", namely the European elm bark beetle \"S. multistriatus\" and the large elm bark beetle \"S. scolytus\", which like the American elm bark beetle \"Hylurgopinus rufipes\", transmit Dutch elm disease fungi (\"Ophiostoma\").  The mountain pine beetle \"Dendroctonus ponderosae\", southern pine beetle \"Dendroctonus frontalis\", and their near relatives are major pests of conifer forests in North America.  A similarly aggressive species in Europe is the spruce ips \"Ips typographus\".  A tiny bark beetle, the coffee berry borer, \"Hypothenemus hampei\" is a major pest on coffee plantations around the world.Context_9: Scydosella Scydosella is a genus of beetles that consists of only one species Scydosella musawasensis.  The species is regarded as the smallest free-living insect, as well as the smallest beetle.  They are among featherwing beetle, named because of their feather-like spiny wings.  It was first discovered in Nicaragua, and described in 1999 by Wesley Eugene Hall of the University of Nebraska State Museum.  The initial discovery consisted of very few specimens, and exact measurements were not conclusive.  Because of their tiny size, they were difficult to observe under microscope after preservation.  The generally accepted size was 0.300\u00a0mm in length.  On 8 February 2015, Alexey Polilov of the Lomonosov Moscow State University collected 85 specimens in Chicaque National Park, Colombia.  They were discovered on a layer of fungus on which they feed.  From these specimens exact measurements could be made, and was found that the smallest individual is only 0.325\u00a0mm long.  The largest individual is 0.352\u00a0mm long, and the average length of all the specimens is 0.338\u00a0mm.  The body is elongated and oval in shape, yellowish-brown in colour, and its antennae are split into 10 segments.Context_10: San Marino San Marino ( ; ] ), officially the Republic of San Marino (Italian: \"Repubblica di San Marino\" ), also known as the Most Serene Republic of San Marino (Italian: \"Serenissima Repubblica di San Marino\" ), is an enclaved microstate surrounded by Italy, situated on the Italian Peninsula on the northeastern side of the Apennine Mountains.

During the Second World War, he worked as a gas van operator at the Che\u0142mno extermination camp in Wartheland.  As an operator of a gas van, Laabs was directly involved in and responsible for the genocidal extermination of over 100,000 men, women and children, most of whom were killed on account of being Jewish.  After the war, he was tried and convicted for his crimes against humanity.  Despite being convicted, Laabs was given the lenient sentence of 15 years (subsequently reduced to 13 years) by a regional court in Landgericht Bonn, Germany.  Far from being outliers, such instances of leniency, extended to perpetrators of genocide and crimes against humanity during trials in post-Nazi Germany, constituted the norm, as evidenced by the fact that most of the perpetrators of Nazi war crimes and the Final Solution were not brought to justice.  Many former SS officers and Nazis, who were directly responsible for perpetrating genocide and murdering countless innocent people, were contracted to work for US and British intelligence agencies as part of the war against the USSR and Communism (also see Operation Paperclip for more on post-WWII Allied collaboration with Nazis).Context_4: Operation Epsilon Operation Epsilon was the codename of a program in which Allied forces near the end of World War II detained ten German scientists who were thought to have worked on Nazi Germany's nuclear program.

After the war, the United States Government's Office of Strategic Services (OSS) brought him to the U.S. as part of the clandestine Operation Paperclip, where he became one of the main developers of the U.S. space program.  He worked within the U.S. Army and NASA, where he managed the development of several systems, including the Pershing missile and the Saturn V Moon rocket.  In 1984, the U.S. Government investigated him for war crimes, and he agreed to renounce his United States citizenship and leave the U.S. in return for not being prosecuted.Context_6: Operation Damocles Operation Damocles was a covert campaign of the Israeli Mossad in August 1962 targeting German scientists and technicians, formerly employed in Nazi Germany's rocket program, who were developing rockets for Egypt at a military site known as Factory 333.  According to Otto Joklik, an Austrian scientist involved with the project, the rockets being developed were programmed to use a radioactive waste.Context_7: Operation Paperclip Operation Paperclip was a secret program of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians, such as Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team, were recruited in post-Nazi Germany and taken to the U.S. for government employment, at the end of World War II; many were members and some were leaders of the Nazi Party.Context_8: History of the Jews in Germany Jewish settlers founded the Ashkenazi Jewish community in the Early (5th to 10th centuries CE) and High Middle Ages (\"circa\" 1000\u20131299 CE).  The community survived under Charlemagne, but suffered during the Crusades.  Accusations of well poisoning during the Black Death (1346\u201353) led to mass slaughter of German Jews, and they fled in large numbers to Poland.  The Jewish communities of the cities of Mainz, Speyer, and Worms became the center of Jewish life during Medieval times.  \"This was a golden age as area bishops protected the Jews resulting in increased trade and prosperity.\"  The First Crusade began an era of persecution of Jews in Germany.  Entire communities, like those of Trier, Worms, Mainz, and Cologne, were murdered.  The war upon the Hussite heretics became the signal for renewed persecution of Jews.  The end of the 15th century was a period of religious hatred that ascribed to Jews all possible evils.  The atrocities during the Khmelnytsky Uprising committed by Khmelnytskyi's Cossacks (1648, in the Ukrainian part of southeastern Poland) drove the Polish Jews back into western Germany.  With Napoleon's fall in 1815, growing nationalism resulted in increasing repression.  From August to October 1819, pogroms that came to be known as the Hep-Hep riots took place throughout Germany.  During this time, many German states stripped Jews of their civil rights.  As a result, many German Jews began to emigrate.Context_9: Adolf Bernhard Meyer Adolf Bernhard Meyer (11 October 1840, Hamburg \u2013 22 August 1911, Dresden) was a German anthropologist, ornithologist, entomologist, and herpetologist.  He served for nearly thirty years as director of the K\u00f6niglich Zoologisches und Anthropologisch-Ethnographisches Museum (now the natural history museum or Museum f\u00fcr Tierkunde Dresden) in Dresden.  He worked on comparative anatomy and appreciated ideas from evolution, and influenced many German scientists by translating the works of Darwin and Wallace into German in 1858.
