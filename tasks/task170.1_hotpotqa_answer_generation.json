", "output": ["Palm Desert, California"]}, {"input": "Context_1: Bicarbonate indicator A bicarbonate indicator (hydrogencarbonate indicator) is a type of pH indicator that is sensitive enough to show a color change as the concentration of carbon dioxide gas in an aqueous solution increases.  The indicator is used in photosynthesis and respiration experiments to find out whether carbon dioxide is being liberated.  It is also used to test the carbon dioxide content during gaseous exchange of organisms.  When the carbon dioxide content is higher than 0.04%, the initial red color changes to yellow as the pH becomes more acidic.  If the carbon dioxide content is lower than 0.04%, it changes from red to magenta and, in relatively very low carbon dioxide concentrations, to purple.  Carbon dioxide, even in the concentrations found in exhaled air, will dissolve in the indicator to form carbonic acid, a weak acid, which will lower the pH and give the characteristic colour change.  A colour change to purple during photosynthesis shows a reduction in the percentage of carbon dioxide and is sometimes inferred as production of oxygen, but there is not actually any direct evidence for it.Context_2: Atelocyanobacterium thalassa \"Candidatus\" Atelocyanobacterium thalassa (previously cyanobacterium UCYN-A,) is a species of cyanobacteria commonly found throughout the world's oceans.  Unlike many other cyanobacteria, \"A. thalassa\" lacks the ability to perform photosynthesis.  Instead, it is found in a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic algae.  \"A. thalassa\" fixes nitrogen for the algae, while the algae provides carbon for \"A. thalassa\" through photosynthesis.Context_3: Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (AAPBs) are alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteriathat are obligate aerobes that capture energy from light by anoxygenic photosynthesis.  Anoxygenic photosynthesis is the phototrophic process where light energy is captured and stored as ATP.  The production of oxygen is non-existent and, therefore, water is not used as an electron donor.  They are widely distributed marine plankton that may constitute over 10% of the open ocean microbial community.  They can be particularly abundant in oligotrophic conditions where they were found to be 24% of the community.  Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria are photoheterotrophic (phototroph)microbes that exist in a variety of aquatic environments.  Photoheterotrophs(Gk: photo = light, hetero = (an)other, troph = nourishment), are heterotrophic organisms that use light to produce energy, but are unable to utilize carbon dioxide as their primary carbon source.  Most are obligately aerobic, meaning they require oxygen to grow.  One remarkable aspect of these novel bacteria is that they, unlike other similar bacteria, are unable to utilize BChl (bacteriochlorophyll) for anaerobic growth.The only photosynthetic pigment that exists in AAPB is BChl a. Anaerobic phototrophic bacteria, on the contrary, can contain numerous species of photosynthetic pigments like bacteriochlorophyll a, b, c, d, e, f, etc.  There is still a large void in the areas regarding the abundance and genetic diversity of the AAPB, as well as the environmental variables that regulate these properties.Context_4: Jan Ingenhousz Jan Ingenhousz or Ingen-Housz FRS (8 December 1730 \u2013 7 September 1799) was a Dutch physiologist, biologist and chemist.  He is best known for showing that light is essential to photosynthesis and thus having discovered photosynthesis.  He also discovered that plants, like animals, have cellular respiration.  In his lifetime he was best known for successfully inoculating the members of the Habsburg family in Vienna against smallpox in 1768 and subsequently being the private counsellor and personal physician to the Austrian Empress Maria Theresa.Context_5: Chlorophyll a Chlorophyll \"a\" is a specific form of chlorophyll used in oxygenic photosynthesis.  It absorbs most energy from wavelengths of violet-blue and orange-red light.  It also reflects green/yellow light, and as such contributes to the observed green color of most plants.  This photosynthetic pigment is essential for photosynthesis in eukaryotes, cyanobacteria and prochlorophytes because of its role as primary electron donor in the electron transport chain.  Chlorophyll \"a\" also transfers resonance energy in the antenna complex, ending in the reaction center where specific chlorophylls P680 and P700 are located.Context_6: Chromatium okenii Chromatium okenii is a Gram-negative bacterium found in water.  It belongs to the Purple sulfur bacteria.  These bacteria are capable of photosynthesis and use Hydrogen sulfide (HS) as an electron donor for CO reduction and so do not produce oxygen.  This type of photosynthesis is called anoxygenic photosynthesis.Context_7: Action spectrum An action spectrum is the rate of a physiological activity plotted against wavelength of light.  It shows which wavelength of light is most effectively used in a specific chemical reaction.  Some reactants are able to use specific wavelengths of light more effectively to complete their reactions.  For example, chlorophyll is much more efficient at using the red and blue spectrums of light to carry out photosynthesis.  Therefore, the action spectrum graph would show spikes above the wavelengths representing the colours red and blue.  Engelmann split light into its components by the prism and then illuminated Cladophora placed in a suspension of aerobic bacteria.  He found that bacteria accumulated in the region of blue and red light of the split spectrum.  He thus discovered the effect of the different wavelengths of light on photosynthesis and plotted the first action spectrum of photosynthesis.Context_8: Chlorophyll Chlorophyll (also chlorophyl) is any of several closely related green pigments found in cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of algae and plants. Its name is derived from the Greek words \u03c7\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, \"chloros\" (\"green\") and \u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, \"phyllon\" (\"leaf\").  Chlorophyll is essential in photosynthesis, allowing plants to absorb energy from light.Context_9: Prochlorococcus Prochlorococcus is a genus of very small (0.6 \u00b5m) marine cyanobacteria with an unusual pigmentation (chlorophyll \"a2\" and \"b2\").  These bacteria belong to the photosynthetic picoplankton and are probably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth.  \"Prochlorococcus\" microbes are among the major primary producers in the ocean, responsible for a large percentage of the photosynthetic production of oxygen.  Analysis of the genome sequences of 12 \"Prochlorococcus\" strains show that 1,100 genes are common to all strains, and the average genome size is about 2,000 genes.  In contrast, eukaryotic algae have over 10,000 genes.Context_10: Auxiliary metabolic genes Auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) are found in many bacteriophages but originated in bacterial cells.  AMGs modulate host cell metabolism during infection so that the phage can replicate more efficiently.  For instance, bacteriophages that infect the abundant marine cyanobacteria \"Synechococcus\" and \"Prochlorococcus\" (cyanophages) carry AMGs that have been acquired from their immediate host as well as more distantly-related bacteria.  Cyanophage AMGs support a variety of functions including photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, nucleic acid synthesis and metabolism.Fact_1: ProchlorococcusFact_2: ChlorophyllQuestion: What is found in Prochlorococcus and essential for photosynthesis?", "output": ["Chlorophyll"]}, {"input": "Context_1: Chelsea Handler Chelsea Joy Handler (born February 25, 1975) is an American comedian, actress, writer, television host, and producer.

The series depicts, in mockumentary style, the behind the scenes goings-on at the office of the late-night talk show \"Chelsea Lately\".  The cast is made up of the actual writers and performers of \"Chelsea Lately\", who play themselves as they suffer the indignities and relish the perks of show business, bicker and argue over trivial and petty matters, compete for show air time and personal approval from Chelsea, and produce a nightly late-night cable comedy show.  Celebrity guest stars regularly appear, playing parody versions of themselves, interacting with Chelsea and the cast.  The series began airing on E! on March 6, 2011.Context_6: MTV Video Music Brazil The MTV Video Music Brazil awards (originally Video Music Awards Brazil), more commonly known as VMB, were MTV Brasil's annual award ceremony, established in 1995.  MTV viewers picked the winners for most categories since 2001.  Unlike in the MTV Video Music Awards, the most important category at the MTV Video Music Brazil was the Viewer's Choice, not the Video of the Year; both of these categories merged in 2005.  In 2007, the awards have faced a major rebranding, with several categories extinguished (most notably the specific genre divisions) and even the trophies' design changed; from this year on, the awards were no longer focused on music videos, but on the artists, and the most important category became the Artist of the Year.  However, the Video of the Year category existed to award the best music video.Context_7: KDWN KDWN (720 AM) is an American radio station owned by Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc. based in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Even though Jost managed several careers of big media artists, he only rarely answers interviews for the press and is known for principally never giving TV interviews.  For his work as a songwriter, Jost was named Germany's best songwriter (Rock & Pop) by the GEMA (the German equivalent to the ASCAP/BMI).  Jost is currently working in his Los Angeles studios.Context_10: Late-night talk show A late-night talk show is a genre of talk show popular in the United States, where the format originated.  It is generally structured around humorous monologues about the day's news, guest interviews, comedy sketches and music performances.  The late-night talk show format was popularized, though not invented, by Johnny Carson with \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" on NBC.  Typically the show's host conducts interviews from behind a desk, while the guest is seated on a couch.  Many late night talk shows feature a house band which generally performs cover songs for the studio audience during commercial breaks and occasionally will back up a guest artist.Fact_1: 2010 MTV Video Music AwardsFact_2: 2010 MTV Video Music AwardsFact_3: Chelsea HandlerQuestion: In which theatre in Los Angeles did the late-night talk show host of \"Chelsea Lately\" host the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards?", "output": ["Nokia Theatre"]}, {"input": "Context_1: Herbie Flowers Brian Keith \"Herbie\" Flowers (born 19 May 1938) is an English musician specialising in electric bass, double bass and tuba.  He is noted as a member of Blue Mink, T. Rex and Sky and as one of Britain's best-known session bass players, having contributed to recordings by Elton John (\"Tumbleweed Connection\", \"Madman Across the Water\"), David Bowie (\"Space Oddity\", \"Diamond Dogs\"), Lou Reed (\"Transformer\", including the prominent bass line of \"Walk on the Wild Side\"), Melanie (\"Candles in the Rain\"), Roy Harper (\"Bullinamingvase\"), David Essex (\"Rock On\"), Allan Clarke, Al Kooper (\"New York City (You're a Woman)\"), Bryan Ferry (\"The Bride Stripped Bare\"), Harry Nilsson (\"Nilsson Schmilsson\", \"Son of Dracula\"), Cat Stevens (\"New Masters\", \"Foreigner\"), Serge Gainsbourg (\"Histoire de Melody Nelson\"), Paul McCartney (\"Give My Regards to Broad Street\"), George Harrison (\"Somewhere in England\", \"Gone Troppo\", \"Brainwashed\") and Ringo Starr (\"Stop and Smell the Roses\").  He also played bass on \"Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds\".  By the end of the 1970s, Flowers had played bass on an estimated 500 hit recordings.Context_2: Bassline A bassline (also known as a bass line or bass part) is the term used in many styles of popular music, such as jazz, blues, funk, dub and electronic, or traditional music, for the low-pitched instrumental part or line played by a rhythm section instrument such as the electric bass, double bass, cello, tuba or keyboard (piano, Hammond organ, electric organ, or synthesizer).  It is also used sometimes in classical music.  In unaccompanied solo performance, basslines may simply be played in the lower register of any instrument such as guitar or piano while melody and/or further accompaniment is provided in the middle or upper register.  In solo music for piano and pipe organ, these instruments have an excellent lower register that can be used to play a deep bassline.  On organs, the bass line is typically played using the pedal keyboard and massive 16' and 32' bass pipes.Context_3: Give My Regards to Broad Street (film) Give My Regards to Broad Street is a 1984 British musical drama film directed by Peter Webb, which starred Paul McCartney, Bryan Brown and Ringo Starr.  The film covers a fictional day in the life of Paul McCartney, who wrote the film for the screen, and McCartney, Starr and Linda McCartney all appeared as themselves.  Despite \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\" being unsuccessful in the box office financially and critically, its soundtrack album sold well.  The title is a take on George M. Cohan's classic show tune \"Give My Regards to Broadway\" which made reference to London's Broad Street railway station, which would close in 1986.Context_4: Press to Play Press to Play is the sixth post-Beatles studio album by the English musician Paul McCartney (outside of Wings' body of work), released in August 1986.  It was McCartney's first album of entirely new music since \"Pipes of Peace\" in 1983, and his first solo album to be issued internationally by EMI following a six-year alliance with Columbia Records in the United States and Canada.  Keen to re-establish himself after his poorly received 1984 musical film \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\", McCartney enlisted producer Hugh Padgham to give the album a contemporary sound.Context_5: Bass (sound) Bass describes tones of low (also called \"deep\") frequency, pitch and range from 16-256 Hz (C0 to middle C4).  In musical compositions, such as songs and pieces, these are the lowest parts of the harmony.  In choral music without instrumental accompaniment, the bass is supplied by adult male bass singers.  In an orchestra, the bass lines are played by the double bass and cellos, bassoon or contrabassoon, low brass such as the tuba and bass trombone, and the timpani (kettledrums).  In many styles of traditional music such as Bluegrass, folk, and in styles such as Rockabilly and Big Band and Bebop jazz, the bass role is filled by the upright bass.  In most rock and pop bands and in jazz fusion groups, the bass role is filled by the electric bass.  In some 20th and 21st century pop genres, such as 1980s pop, hip hop music and Electronic Dance Music, the bass role may be filled with a bass synthesizer.Context_6: Jamil Nasser Jamil Nasser, born George Joyner (June 21, 1932 \u2013 February 13, 2010) and also credited on some of Ahmad Jamal's recordings as Jamil Sulieman, was an American jazz musician.  He played double bass, electric bass, and tuba.Context_7: Haunting the Chapel Haunting the Chapel is an EP released by American thrash metal band Slayer in 1984 through Metal Blade and Enigma Records.  Slayer's debut album \"Show No Mercy\" became Metal Blade's highest selling, leading to producer Brian Slagel wanting to release an EP.  Recorded in Hollywood, the recording process proved difficult when recording drums in a studio without carpet, although it resulted in drummer Dave Lombardo meeting Gene Hoglan who was to become an influence in his drumming style and speed.  It was during the recording of this session that Lombardo first had the double bass added to his kit.  Hoglan, working for Slayer at the time, sat at the kit and played a double bass for the first time.  Lombardo was impressed and although Hoglan never gave him lessons, he did give him tips regarding the use of the double kick drum.Context_8: The Black Swans The Black Swans are an indie rock band.  Jerry DeCicca (vocals and acoustic guitar) and Noel Sayre (viola and violin) form the core of the band.  Their debut, \"Who Will Walk in the Darkness with You? \" features Milan Karcic (electric guitar), Matt Surgeson (electric bass, double bass), Joe Peppercorn (piano), and Jovan Karcic (drums).  The \"Sex Brain\" EP features Canaan Faulkner (bass), Chris Forbes (electric guitar), Keith Hanlon (drums, electric guitar), Sarah Jurcyk (backing vocals), and Horace Roscoe (alto saxophone).  Amy Alwood and Cassie Lewis are also listed as group members.  The Black Swans have toured America with such notable indie artists as Okkervil River, and Early Day Miners.  Their 2nd full-length album, \"Change! \", was released on November 6, 2007 by La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Exp\u00e9ditionnaire on CD and LP.  It features the same core band of DeCicca, Sayre, Faulkner, Forbes and Hanlon that appeared on \"Sex Brain\", as well as appearances by Peppercorn on piano and Amy Alwood on backing vocals.  It was recorded in Forbes' living room by Hanlon and mixed by Hanlon and DeCicca at Gidget Sound in Columbus, Ohio.Context_9: Give My Regards to Broad Street Give My Regards to Broad Street is the fifth studio album by Paul McCartney, as well as the soundtrack album to his 1984 film of the same name.  The album reached number 1 on the UK chart.  The lead single, \"No More Lonely Nights\", was BAFTA and Golden Globe Award nominated.  It was also to be his final album to be released under Columbia Records, which had been his US Label for over 5 years.Context_10: Bassist A bassist, or bass player, is a musician who plays a bass instrument such as a double bass, bass guitar, keyboard bass or a low brass instrument such as a tuba or sousaphone.  Different musical genres tend to be associated with one or more of these instruments.  Since the 1960s, the electric bass has been the standard bass instrument for funk, R&B, soul music, rock and roll, reggae, jazz fusion, heavy metal, country and pop music.  The double bass is the standard bass instrument for classical music, bluegrass, rockabilly, and most genres of jazz.  Low brass instruments such as the tuba or sousaphone are the standard bass instrument in Dixieland and New Orleans-style jazz bands.Fact_1: Herbie FlowersFact_2: Give My Regards to Broad StreetQuestion: Brian Keith \"Herbie\" Flowers, is an English musician specialising in electric bass, double bass and tuba, he has contributed to the recording Give My Regards to Broad Street is the fifth studio album by who, as well as the soundtrack album to his 1984 film of the same name?", "output": ["Paul McCartney"]}, {"input": "Context_1: Second Silesian War The Second Silesian War was a theatre of the War of the Austrian Succession.  The name is used to describe Prussia's war against Austria between 1744 and 1745, fought mainly in Silesia, Bohemia, and Upper Saxony.  It was the second in a series of three Silesian Wars fought between Frederick the Great's Prussia and Maria Theresa's Austria.Context_2: First Silesian War The First Silesian War was a theatre of the War of the Austrian Succession.  The name is used to describe Prussia's war against Austria between 1740 and 1742, fought mainly in Silesia, Moravia and Bohemia (the lands of the Bohemian Crown).  It became the first in a series of three Silesian Wars fought between Frederick the Great's Prussia and Maria Theresa's Austria.Context_3: Battle of Mollwitz The Battle of Mollwitz was fought by Prussia and Austria on 10 April 1741, during the First Silesian War (in the early stages of the War of the Austrian Succession).  It was the first battle of the new Prussian King Frederick II, in which both sides made numerous military blunders but Frederick the Great still managed to attain victory.  This battle cemented his authority over the newly conquered territory of Silesia and gave him valuable military experience.Context_4: Battle of Chotusitz The Battle of Chotusitz, or Chotusice, sometimes called the Battle of Czaslau, was fought on May 17, 1742, in Bohemia between the Austrians under Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine and the Prussians under Frederick the Great.  The battle was a part of the War of the Austrian Succession, sometimes referred to as the First Silesian War.  The armies were about equal at 28,000 to 30,000 each, with the Prussians having about 2,000 more infantry and the Austrians some 2,000 more cavalry.  The Austrians were attempting to retake occupied Prague and the Prussians were trying to block them from accomplishing that.  The battle of Chotusitz was especially notable in that it was the only major battle started by the Austrians during this war.Context_5: Treaty of Breslau The Treaty of Breslau was a preliminary peace agreement signed on 11 June 1742 following long negotiations at the Silesian capital Wroc\u0142aw (German: \"Breslau\" ) by emissaries of Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria and King Frederick II of Prussia ending the First Silesian War.Context_6: Treaty of Berlin (1742) The Treaty of Berlin between the Habsburg archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, who was also Queen of Bohemia, and the Prussian king Frederick the Great was signed on 28 July 1742 in Berlin.  It was the formal peace treaty that confirmed the preliminary agreement achieved with English mediation by the 11 June Treaty of Breslau, and officially ended the First Silesian War.Context_7: Silesian Wars The Silesian Wars (German: \"Schlesische Kriege\" ) were a series of three wars fought in the mid-18th century between Prussia (under King Frederick the Great) and Austria (under Empress Maria Theresa) for control of Silesia, all three of which ended in Prussian victory.  The First (1740\u201342) and Second (1744\u201345) Silesian Wars formed a part of the larger War of the Austrian Succession, while the Third Silesian War (1756\u201363) was one theater of the Seven Years' War.Context_8: Frederick the Great Frederick II (German: \"Friedrich\" ; 24 January 171217 August 1786) was King of Prussia from 1740 until 1786, the longest reign of any Hohenzollern king.  His most significant accomplishments during his reign included his military victories, his reorganization of Prussian armies, his patronage of the arts and the Enlightenment in Prussia, and his final success against great odds in the Seven Years' War.  Frederick was the last titled King in Prussia and declared himself King of Prussia after achieving full sovereignty for all historical Prussian lands.  Prussia had greatly increased its territories and became a leading military power in Europe under his rule.  He became known as Frederick the Great (\"Friedrich der Gro\u00dfe \") and was affectionately nicknamed \"Der Alte Fritz \" (\"Old Fritz\") by the Prussian and later by all German people.Context_9: Third Silesian War The Third Silesian War was a theatre of the Seven Years' War.  The name is used to describe Prussia's war against Austria and its allies between 1756 and 1763, fought mainly in Silesia, Bohemia and Upper Saxony.  The war was the third and last in a series of Silesian Wars fought between Frederick the Great's Prussia and Maria Theresa's Austria; like the earlier two, it ended with Prussia in control of the region of Silesia.Context_10: Treaty of Hubertusburg The Treaty of Hubertusburg (German: \"Frieden von Hubertusburg\" ) was signed on 15 February 1763 at Hubertusburg Castle by Prussia, Austria and Saxony to end the Third Silesian War.  Together with the Treaty of Paris, signed five days earlier, it marked the end of the Seven Years' War.  The treaty ended the continental conflict with no significant changes in prewar borders.  Austria and Saxony renounced all claims to the Silesian territories ceded to Prussia in the 1742 Treaty of Berlin and the 1745 Treaty of Dresden.  Prussia clearly stood among the ranks of the European great powers, while the treaty enhanced the rivalry with Austria.Fact_1: First Silesian WarFact_2: Frederick the GreatQuestion: The First Silesian war was fought against the King of Prussia who died in what year?", "output": ["1786"]}, {"input": "Context_1: Chandrasekhar limit The Chandrasekhar limit ( ) is the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf star.  The limit was first indicated in papers published by Wilhelm Anderson and E. C. Stoner, and was named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, the Indian astrophysicist who independently discovered and improved upon the accuracy of the calculation in 1930, at the age of 19, in India.  This limit was initially ignored by the community of scientists because such a limit would logically require the existence of black holes, which were considered a scientific impossibility at the time.  White dwarfs resist gravitational collapse primarily through electron degeneracy pressure.  (By comparison, main sequence stars resist collapse through thermal pressure.)  The Chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction.  Consequently, white dwarfs with masses greater than the limit would be subject to further gravitational collapse, evolving into a different type of stellar remnant, such as a neutron star or black hole.  (However, white dwarfs generally avoid this fate by exploding before they undergo collapse.)  Those with masses under the limit remain stable as white dwarfs.Context_2: Chandrasekhar potential energy tensor In astrophysics, Chandrasekhar potential energy tensor provides the gravitational potential of a body due to its own gravity created by the distribution of matter across the body, named after the Indian American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.  The Chandrasekhar tensor is a generalization of potential energy in other words, the trace of the Chandrasekhar tensor provides the potential energy of the body.Context_3: Sch\u00f6nberg\u2013Chandrasekhar limit In stellar astrophysics, the Sch\u00f6nberg\u2013Chandrasekhar limit is the maximum mass of a non-fusing, isothermal core that can support an enclosing envelope.  It is expressed as the ratio of the core mass to the total mass of the core and envelope.  Estimates of the limit depend on the models used and the assumed chemical compositions of the core and envelope; typical values given are from 0.10 to 0.15 (10% to 15% of the total stellar mass).  This is the maximum to which a helium-filled core can grow, and if this limit is exceeded, as can only happen in massive stars, the core collapses, releasing energy that causes the outer layers of the star to expand to become a red giant.  It is named after the astrophysicists Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Mario Sch\u00f6nberg, who estimated its value in a 1942 paper.Context_4: Chandrasekhar family The Chandrasekhar family is an Indian intellectual family.  Several members of the family have achieved scientific distinction, notably in the field of physics.  Two members of the family, Sir C. V. Raman and his nephew, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, were Nobel laureates in physics.Context_5: Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, FRS (Tamil: \u0b9a\u0bc1\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bae\u0ba3\u0bbf\u0baf\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0b9a\u0bc7\u0b95\u0bb0\u0bcd ; ; 19 October 1910 \u2013 21 August 1995), was an Indian American astrophysicist who was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics with William A. Fowler \"for his theoretical studies of the physical processes of importance to the structure and evolution of the stars\".  His mathematical treatment of stellar evolution yielded many of the best current theoretical models of the later evolutionary stages of massive stars and black holes.  The Chandrasekhar limit is named after him.Context_6: Collapsar Collapsar is the shortened form to describe a collapsed star.  When an old star no longer has enough fuel for significant fusion reactions there can be three possible outcomes depending on the star's mass.  If the star\u2019s mass is less than 1.4 solar masses, known as the Chandrasekhar limit, it will stabilize and shrink, becoming a white dwarf.  Above the said limit the star will either become a neutron star or a black hole.Context_7: Chandrasekhar equation In astrophysics, the Chandrasekhar equation is a dimensionless form of the Poisson equation for the density distribution of a spherically symmetric isothermal gas sphere subjected to its own gravitaional force, named after the Indian American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.  The equation readsContext_8: List of supernova candidates This is a list of supernova candidates, or stars that astronomers have suggested are supernova progenitors.  Type II supernova progenitors include stars with at least 10 solar masses that are in the final stages of their evolution.  Prominent examples of stars in this mass range include Antares, Spica, Gamma Velorum, Mu Cephei, and members of the Quintuplet Cluster.  Type Ia supernova progenitors are white dwarf stars that are close to the Chandrasekhar limit of about 1.44 solar masses and are accreting matter from a binary companion star.  The list includes massive Wolf\u2013Rayet stars, which may become Type Ib/Ic supernovae.Context_9: Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit The Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit (or TOV limit) (also referred to as the Landau\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit (or LOV limit)) is an upper bound to the mass of stars composed of neutron-degenerate matter (i.e. neutron stars).  The TOV limit is analogous to the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarf stars.  It is approximately 1.5 to 3.0 solar masses, corresponding to an original stellar mass of 15 to 20 solar masses.Context_10: KPD 1930+2752 KPD 1930+2752 is a binary star system including a Subdwarf B star and a probable white dwarf with relatively high mass.  Due to the nature of this astronomical system, it seems like a likely candidate for a potential type Ia supernova, a type of supernova which occurs when a white dwarf star takes on enough matter to approach the Chandrasekhar limit, the point at which electron degeneracy pressure would not be enough to support its mass.  However, carbon fusion would occur before this limit was reached, releasing enough energy to overcome the force of gravity holding the star together and resulting in a supernova.Fact_1: Chandrasekhar familyFact_2: Chandrasekhar familyFact_3: Subrahmanyan ChandrasekharFact_4: Subrahmanyan ChandrasekharQuestion: The Chandrasekhar limit was named after an astrophysicist, what is the name of his uncle of which is also a novel laureate?", "output": ["Sir C.

These discs were usually small, had poor audio quality compared to vinyl or acetate discs, and were often only marginally playable due to their light weight, slick surface, and tendency to warp like a taco shell.  Playability could be improved by placing a coin between the lock groove and the spindle hole to add weight and stability.  These records are distinct from both flexi discs, which are sturdier, and from many of the old home-recording discs since cardboard discs were mass-produced for a specific purpose.Context_3: Al-Ca composite Al-Ca composite is a high-conductivity, high-strength, lightweight composite consisting of sub-micron-diameter pure calcium metal filaments embedded inside a pure aluminium metal matrix.  The material is still in the development phase, but it has potential use as an overhead high-voltage power transmission conductor.  It could also be used wherever an exceptionally light, high-strength conductor is needed.  Its physical properties make it especially well-suited for DC transmission.  Compared with conventional conductors such as aluminium-conductor steel-reinforced cable (ACSR), all aluminium alloy conductors (AAAC), aluminium conductor alloy reinforced (ACAR), aluminium conductor composite reinforced ACCR and ACCC conductor that conduct AC current well and DC current somewhat less well (due to the skin effect), Al-Ca conductor is essentially a single uniform material with high DC conductivity, allowing the core strands and the outer strands of a conductor cable to all be the same wire type.  This conductor is inherently strong so that there is no need for a strong (usually poorly conductive) core to support its own weight as is done in conventional conductors.  This eliminates the \"bird caging\", spooling, and thermal fatigue problems caused by thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the core and outer strands.  The Al-Ca phase interfaces strengthen the composite substantially, but do not have a noticeable effect on restricting the mean free path of electrons, which gives the composite both high strength and high conductivity, a combination that is normally difficult to achieve with both pure metals and alloys.  The high strength and light weight could reduce the number of towers needed per kilometer for long distance transmission lines.  Since towers and their foundations often account for 50% of a powerline's construction cost, building fewer towers would save a substantial fraction of total construction costs.  The high strength also could increase transmission reliability in wind/ice loading situations.  The high conductivity has the potential to reduce Ohmic losses.Context_4: Maximum Fighting Championship Maximum Fighting Championship is a Canadian mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion based in Edmonton, Alberta.

The M7 had significantly less armor than the M4 Sherman, boasted no greater firepower, and held only a slight advantage in top speed.  For these reasons, and because the M4 was already battle-tested and in full production, the M7 was put aside shortly after completing trials.Context_10: Terao Tsunefumi Terao Tsunefumi (\u5bfa\u5c3e \u5e38\u53f2 , born February 2, 1963 as Yoshifumi Fukuzono \u798f\u8597 \u597d\u6587) is a Japanese former sumo wrestler.

It was released in a four-disc 10-inch 78-rpm record box, in both a two-disc 7-inch 45-rpm extended-play foldout album and a four-disc 45-rpm regular-play box and on a 10-inch 33\u2153-rpm album.  The serial number, 222, coincidentally included James's lucky number, \"22,\" which appeared in many of her record serial numbers all over the world.  The album is the first to present its songs as a book in music, opening with \"Let There Be Love\" and closing with \"I'll Be Seeing You\", with the songs telling a story start to finish.  The memorable cover was done at M-G-M Pictures Studios in Culver City by artist Russ Gale.  From the album a single of \"Let There Be Love\" and \"You're Nearer\" was shipped to radio stations.  Then, by public demand, a single of \"You're My Everything\" and \"You're Nearer\" was released.  This album offered Joni's second recording of \"Let There Be Love,\" which had been released in an earlier version in 1952 as her first single on Sharp Records in Chicago, then going to M-G-M Records for further distribution.  Both recordings were arranged and conducted by Lew Douglas.  \"Let There Be Love\" went to the top of the album charts and was the sixth-best-selling album of 1953.  In 1956 the album was reissued as a 12-inch L.P. and in three single EPs; there was no EP set including the entire album.  For this release, four Joni James singles were added, but one of them had never been released.  That was \"I Need You Now,\" which was to have followed the hit \"My Love, My Love\" but was canceled when Eddie Fisher came out with a version recorded several weeks after Joni's.  M-G-M had expected Joni's original version to go straight to #1.  For the new album the first four songs and second four songs were switched to get \"You're My Everything\" in the outside groove of the L.P. to facilitate disc jockey play.  So, for 50 years, the story the album tells has been garbled.  In 1961 the album got new cover art, a new serial number (E3931), and an electronically simulated stereo release.  Released again on compact disk with yet more bonus tracks, the album is in its fifth decade as a best seller.  Joni James hopes for yet another release which will restore the original song order.  Significantly, for her last M-G-M album, \"Bossa Nova Style\", Joni included new recordings of several songs from \"Let There Be Love\", including a new single of \"You're Nearer.\"  That album was arranged by Lew Douglas's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Chuck Sagle.

For example, it is possible that variations in six observed variables mainly reflect the variations in two unobserved (underlying) variables.  Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved latent variables.  The observed variables are modelled as linear combinations of the potential factors, plus \"error\" terms.  Factor analysis aims to find independent latent variables.  Followers of factor analytic methods believe that the information gained about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset.  Factor analysis is commonly used in biology, psychometrics personality theories, marketing, product management, operations research and finance.  Users of factor analysis believe that it helps to deal with data sets where there are large numbers of observed variables that are thought to reflect a smaller number of underlying/latent variables.  It is one of the most commonly used inter-dependency techniques and is used when the relevant set of variables shows a systematic inter-dependence and the objective is to find out the latent factors that create a commonality.Context_2: Oh, with the verbing! Oh, with the verbing!  is a phrase commonly used in TV shows and movies, first used by comedian Jerry Lewis.  The literal phrase \"Oh, with the verbing!\"  itself is normally used with a verb replacing \"verbing,\" such as \"screaming, stabbing, bleeding,\" hence the name of the phrase.  Similar lines related to the phrase are spoken as \"The verbing, and the verbing\" and \"Again with the verbing\" and other similar dialogue.Context_3: Lest we forget (phrase) The phrase \"Lest we forget\" is commonly used in war remembrance services and commemorative occasions in English speaking countries, in particular Remembrance Day and ANZAC Day.  Before the term was used in reference to soldiers and war, it was first used in a 1897 Christian poem written by Rudyard Kipling called \"Recessional\".  The phrase occurs 8 times; and is repeated at the end of the first 4 stanzas in order to add particular emphasis regarding the dangers of failing to remember.Context_4: Have a nice day Have a nice day is a commonly spoken expression used to conclude a conversation (whether brief or extensive), or end a message by hoping the person to whom it is addressed experiences a pleasant day.  Since it is often uttered by service employees to customers at the end of a transaction, particularly in Israel and the United States, its repetitious and dutiful usage has resulted in the phrase developing, according to some journalists and scholars, especially outside of these two countries, a cultural connotation of impersonality, lack of interest, passive\u2013aggressive behavior, or sarcasm.  The phrase is generally not used in Europe, as some find it artificial or even offensive.  Critics of the phrase characterize it as an imperative, obliging the person to have a nice day.  Other critics argue that it is a parting platitude that comes across as pretended.  While defenders of the phrase agree that \"Have a nice day\" can be used insincerely, they consider the phrase to be comforting, in that it improves interactions among people.  Others favor the phrase because it does not require a response.Context_5: Virtual population analysis Virtual population analysis (VPA) is a cohort modeling technique commonly used in fisheries science for reconstructing historical fish numbers at age using information on death of individuals each year.  This death is usually partitioned into catch by fisheries and natural mortality.  VPA is virtual in the sense that the population size is not observed or measured directly but is inferred or back-calculated to have been a certain size in the past in order to support the observed fish catches and an assumed death rate owing to non-fishery related causes.Context_6: Divers hands Divers hands (or more rarely dyvers hands), is an archaic phrase used to refer to a project that has been contributed to by many people. \" Divers\" is a word of Latin origin (\"diversus\") that is still commonly used in modern French language; it literally means \"many and varied\".  This usage of the word \"Divers\" can be found in the Bible and other older texts, but it is not commonly used in modern English.  The phrase is still used to refer to the authorship of plays, essay collections, and short story collections by multiple authors.Context_7: Set phrase A set phrase or fixed phrase is a phrase whose parts are fixed in a certain order, even if the phrase could be changed without harming the literal meaning.  This is because a set phrase is a culturally accepted phrase.  A set phrase does not necessarily have any literal meaning in and of itself.  Set phrases may function as idioms (e.g. \"red herring\") or as words with a unique referent (e.g. \"Red Sea\").  There is no clear dividing line between a commonly used phrase and a set phrase.  It is also not easy to draw a clear distinction between set phrases and compound words.Context_8: Substitute teacher A substitute teacher is a person who teaches a school class when the regular teacher is unavailable; e.g., because of illness, personal leave, or other reasons.  \"Substitute teacher\" (usually abbreviated as \"sub\") is the most commonly used phrase in the United States, Canada, India and Ireland, while supply teacher is the most commonly used term in Great Britain and the Canadian province of Ontario.  Common synonyms for substitute teacher include relief teacher or casual teacher (used in Australia and New Zealand) and \"emergency teacher\" (used in some of the United States).  Other terms, such as \"guest teacher\", are also used by some schools or districts.  Regional variants in terminology are common, such as the use of the term teacher on call (T.O.C.) in the Canadian province of British Columbia and occasional in Ontario.Context_9: All flesh is grass All flesh is grass is a much-quoted phrase from the Old Testament, Isaiah 40:6 (Hebrew: \u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05dc\u05be\u05d4\u05b7\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b8\u05c2\u05a3\u05e8 \u05d7\u05b8\u05e6\u05b4\u0594\u05d9\u05e8\u200e \u200e \"kol habbasar chatsir\").

It was a commonly used epitaph, frequently found for example on old ledger stones and monuments in churches in 17th century England.  The phrase is interpreted to mean that human life is transitory.  It has been used in various works, including:Context_10: Anzac Day Anzac Day is a national day of remembrance in Australia and New Zealand that broadly commemorates all Australians and New Zealanders \"who served and died in all wars, conflicts, and peacekeeping operations\" and \"the contribution and suffering of all those who have served\".

The Grand Lodge of Ohio follows the Anglo-American tradition of Freemasonry that is common in the United States.  In 2013, the Grand Lodge reported a total membership of 91,040.Context_2: Masonic lodge A Masonic lodge, often termed a private lodge or constituent lodge, is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry.  It is also commonly, but erroneously, used as a term for a building in which such a unit meets.  Every new lodge must be warranted or chartered by a Grand Lodge, but is subject to its direction only in enforcing the published constitution of the jurisdiction.  By exception the three surviving lodges that formed the world's first known grand lodge in London (now merged into the United Grand Lodge of England) have the unique privilege to operate as \"time immemorial\", i.e., without such warrant; only one other lodge operates without a warrant \u2013 the Grand Stewards' Lodge in London, although it is not also entitled to the \"time immemorial\" title.  A Freemason is generally entitled to visit any Lodge in any jurisdiction (i.e., under any Grand Lodge) in amity with his own.  In some jurisdictions this privilege is restricted to Master Masons (that is, Freemasons who have attained the Order's third degree).  He is first usually required to check, and certify, the regularity of the relationship of the Lodge \u2013 and be able to satisfy that Lodge of his regularity of membership.  Freemasons gather together as a Lodge to work the three basic Degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft and Master Mason.Context_3: Prince Hall Freemasonry Prince Hall Freemasonry is a branch of North American Freemasonry founded by Prince Hall on September 29, 1784 and composed predominantly of African Americans.

Many of these received charters from North American Grand Lodges to establish Masonic Lodges.  They were the first or among the first internationally recognized Masonic Lodges operating in Germany since 1933.  In 1954, the first American Lodge sought and was granted a warrant by a native German Grand Lodge, and during the next year, the number expanded to nine, becoming an American District under the United Grand Lodge (now the Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of Germany (GL AFuAMvD)).  Differences in language and ritual, mutually recognised, led to the establishment of first a provincial Grand Lodge, then an independent American Canadian Grand LodgeContext_5: Anglo-American Freemasonry Anglo-American Freemasonry (Also self-described as Regular Freemasonry) is a term used to describe a loose network of overlapping chains of mutually recognized Grand Lodges that (for the most part) trace their descent from one of \"original\" British Grand Lodges (the Premier Grand Lodge of England, the Antients Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and the Grand Lodge of Ireland); with mutual recognition based on adherence to certain core values, rules and membership requirements (known as Landmarks).Context_6: Masonic Order of Liberia The Grand Lodge of the Republic of Liberia is a fraternal organization based on the principles of Prince Hall Freemasonry.  Prior to 1980, its membership tended to consist of Americo-Liberians and it was influential within the ruling True Whig party from its founding until the coup of Samuel Doe in 1980, when much of its senior leadership was killed and the new military regime banned masonic activities in the country.Context_7: History of Masonic Grand Lodges in North America This is a chronology of the formation of \"regular\" or \"mainstream\" Masonic Grand Lodges in North America, descending from the original Grand Lodge of England (GLE) or its rival, the Antient Grand Lodge of England.

The main masonic influences (and external supervision) have been from the United Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Scotland, the Grand Lodge of Ireland, and a now extinct French Grand Lodge.  Today regular Freemasonry in the country is under the sovereign jurisdiction of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta, formed in 2004 whilst continental Freemasonry in country is under the sovereign jurisdiction of Grand Lodge of Malta whose members broke away from the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta in 2009. The Grand Lodge of Malta is recognized by several continental Masonic bodies including the Grand Orient de FranceContext_9: Premier Grand Lodge of England The Premier Grand Lodge of England was founded on 24 June 1717 as the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster, later calling itself the Grand Lodge of England.  Convention calls it the Premier Grand Lodge of England to distinguish it from the \"Most Ancient and Honourable Society of Free and Accepted Masons according to the Old Constitutions\", more usually referred to as the Ancient Grand Lodge of England, and the \"Grand Lodge of All England Meeting at York\".  It existed until 1813 when it united with the Ancient Grand Lodge of England to create the United Grand Lodge of England.  It was the first Masonic Grand Lodge to be created.Context_10: Grand Lodge of All England The Grand Lodge of All England \"Meeting since Time Immemorial in the City of York\" was a body of Freemasons which existed intermittently during the Eighteenth Century, mainly based in the City of York.  It does not appear to have been a regulatory body in the usual manner of a masonic Grand Lodge, and as such is seen as a \"Mother Lodge\" like Kilwinning in Scotland.  It met to create Freemasons, and as such enabled the foundation of new lodges.  For much of its career, it was the only lodge in its own jurisdiction, but even with dependent lodges it continued to function mainly as an ordinary lodge of Freemasons.  Having existed since at least 1705 as the \"Ancient Society of Freemasons in the City of York\", it was in 1725, possibly in response to the expansion of the new Grand Lodge in London, that they styled themselves the \"Grand Lodge of All England Meeting at York\".  Activity ground to a halt some time in the 1730s, but was revived with renewed vigour in 1761.  It was during this second period of activity that part of the Lodge of Antiquity, having quit the Grand Lodge of England in London, allied themselves with their Northern brethren and became, between 1779 and 1789, the \"Grand Lodge of All England South of the River Trent\".  Shortly after Antiquity's re-absorption into the London Grand Lodge she had founded, the Grand Lodge at York ceased to function again, this time for good.Fact_1: Masonic Order of LiberiaFact_2: Prince Hall FreemasonryQuestion: The Grand Lodge of the Republic of Liberia is based on a branch of North American Freemasonry founded on what date?", "output": ["September 29, 1784"]}, {"input": "Context_1: Ontario Young Liberals The Ontario Young Liberals (OYL) is the official youth wing of the Ontario Liberal Party, and until 2017, of Liberal Party of Canada in Ontario.

It was assembled in response to the solid organisation of the Labor Party and had the aim of assisting Ministerial members in winning seats and retaining power in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly.  The Party did not involve itself in Federal politics, although many of its members were also associated with the Commonwealth Liberal Party and assisted Liberal candidates and members from Western Australia in that capacity.  The massive defeat of the Ministerial faction by Labor in that election resulted in what remained of the faction formally joining the Liberal Party, which became the first organised non-Labor movement in the State and was a precursor to the Nationalist Party and, later, the modern Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division).Context_3: Margarete Bonnevie Margarete Ottilie Bonnevie (n\u00e9e Skatteb\u00f8l) (13 December 1884, Nesbyen \u2014 28 March 1970, Oslo) was a Norwegian author, feminist and politician for the Liberal Party of Norway.

They would be without him in the playoffs, extending a then-franchise record to eight consecutive seasons even though the Suns finished the regular season with the team's first losing record since the 1976\u201377 season.  The Suns' playoff run would not last long, being swept in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs by the eventual league champions, the Los Angeles Lakers.

A similar doctrine is taught in Lutheran churches, where penitents who wish to receive Holy Absolution are also asked to use the Ten Commandments as a guide.  The process is very similar to the Islamic practice of Muhasaba, or self-reflection.Context_9: The Ten Commandments (1956 film) The Ten Commandments is a 1956 American biblical epic film produced, directed, and narrated by Cecil B.

The venear of a Confederacy, which was the main theme of his scheme, could anytime be set aside and the remainder would have precisely... Pakistan.

Ali also stated that originally it was proposed to publish the book under the title of \"Pakistan\" a typed manuscript which bore this page title was sent to the press.

It was established in 1880 as a publishing company.  It is a part of the RELX Group, known until 2015 as Reed Elsevier.  Its products include journals such as \"The Lancet\" and \"Cell\", the ScienceDirect collection of electronic journals, the \"Trends\" and \"Current Opinion\" series of journals, the online citation database Scopus, and the ClinicalKey solution for clinicians.  Elsevier's products and services include the entire academic research lifecycle, including software and data-management, instruction and assessment tools.Context_2: Magnetic resonance velocimetry Magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) is an experimental method to obtain velocity fields in fluid mechanics.  MRV is based on the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance and adapts a medical magnetic resonance imaging system for the analysis of technical flows.  The velocities are usually obtained by phase contrast tomography techniques.  This means velocities are calculated from phase differences in the image data that has been produced using special gradient techniques.  MRV can be applied using common medical MRI scanners.  The term \"magnetic resonance velocimetry\" became current due to the increasing use of MR technology for the measurement of technical flows in engineering.Context_3: Strain\u2013encoded magnetic resonance imaging Strain\u2013encoded magnetic resonance imaging (SENC-MRI) is a magnetic resonance imaging a technique for imaging the strain of deforming tissue.  It is undergoing testing to diagnose some heart diseases, particularly congenital right ventricle dysfunctions, which are difficult to diagnose.  It is an improvement on magnetic resonance elastography in that it has a faster imaging time, and less post-processing time, to turn the acquired data into a useful image.Context_4: Magnetic resonance neurography Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is the direct imaging of nerves in the body by optimizing selectivity for unique MRI water properties of nerves.  It is a modification of magnetic resonance imaging.  This technique yields a detailed image of a nerve from the resonance signal that arises from in the nerve itself rather than from surrounding tissues or from fat in the nerve lining.  Because of the intraneural source of the image signal, the image provides a medically useful set of information about the internal state of the nerve such as the presence of irritation, nerve swelling (edema), compression, pinch or injury.  Standard magnetic resonance images can show the outline of some nerves in portions of their courses but do not show the intrinsic signal from nerve water.  Magnetic resonance neurography is used to evaluate major nerve compressions such as those affecting the sciatic nerve (e.g. piriformis syndrome), the brachial plexus nerves (e.g. thoracic outlet syndrome), the pudendal nerve, or virtually any named nerve in the body.  A related technique for imaging neural tracts in the brain and spinal cord is called magnetic resonance tractography or diffusion tensor imaging.Context_5: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), sometimes known as cardiac MRI, is a medical imaging technology for the non-invasive assessment of the function and structure of the cardiovascular system.  It is derived from and based on the same basic principles as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but with optimization for use in the cardiovascular system.  These optimizations are principally in the use of ECG gating and rapid imaging techniques or sequences.  By combining a variety of such techniques into protocols, key functional and morphological features of the cardiovascular system can be assessed.Context_6: Fast low angle shot magnetic resonance imaging Fast low angle shot magnetic resonance imaging (FLASH MRI) is a particular sequence of magnetic resonance imaging.  It is a gradient echo sequence which combines a low-flip angle radio-frequency excitation of the nuclear magnetic resonance signal (recorded as a spatially encoded gradient echo) with a rapid repetition time.  It is the generic form of steady-state free precession imaging.Context_7: Nuclear magnetic resonance Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a physical phenomenon in which nuclei in a magnetic field absorb and re-emit electromagnetic radiation.  This energy is at a specific resonance frequency which depends on the strength of the magnetic field and the magnetic properties of the isotope of the atoms; in practical applications, the frequency is similar to VHF and UHF television broadcasts (60\u20131000\u00a0MHz).  NMR allows the observation of specific quantum mechanical magnetic properties of the atomic nucleus.  Many scientific techniques exploit NMR phenomena to study molecular physics, crystals, and non-crystalline materials through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  NMR is also routinely used in advanced medical imaging techniques, such as in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Context_8: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (journal) Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a peer-reviewed scientific journal published by Elsevier, encompassing biology, physics, and clinical science as they relate to the development and use of magnetic resonance imaging technology.  \"Magnetic Resonance Imaging\" was established in 1982 and the current editor-in-chief is John C. Gore.  The journal produces 10 issues per year.Context_9: Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) is a specific type of magnetic resonance imaging used primarily to determine flow velocities.  PC-MRI can be considered a method of Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry.

He is regarded as the father of modern functional brain imaging.  He determined that the changes in blood oxygen levels cause its magnetic resonance imaging properties to change, allowing a map of blood, and hence, functional, activity in the brain to be created.  This map reflected which neurons of the brain responded with electrochemical signals to mental processes.  He was the first scientist who demonstrated that the functional brain imaging is depended on the oxygenation status of the blood, the BOLD effect.  The technique was therefore called Blood oxygenation level-dependent or BOLD contrast.  Functional MRI (fMRI) has been used to map the visual, auditory and sensory regions and moving toward higher brain functions such as cognitive functions in the brain.Fact_1: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (journal)Fact_2: ElsevierQuestion: When was the company that publishes the journal Magnetic Resonance Imaging established ?", "output": ["1880"]}, {"input": "Context_1: The Ballad of Ian Hunter and Mott the Hoople Shades of Ian Hunter: The Ballad of Ian Hunter and Mott the Hoople is a compilation album by Ian Hunter, consisting of tracks by Hunter's previous band Mott the Hoople, and solo Hunter tracks as well.
