            "input": "Context_1: Heartbreak Express Heartbreak Express is Dolly Parton's 24th solo studio album.  Released in April 1982, the album returned Parton to a more fully realized country sound (a process she had begun on the previous year's \"9 to 5 and Odd Jobs\"), after her late 1970s pop recordings.  The album's first single, \"Single Women\", a slow-tempo honkytonk ballad about a singles bar, was written by \"Saturday Night Live\" writer Michael O'Donoghue, and had previously appeared in an \"SNL\" skit in late 1980.  The single provided a top ten single for Parton.  The title cut also was a top ten hit for her.  \"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind\" (a song Parton had written in the early 1970s but had never \"officially\" recorded) appeared as a double-A-sided single (along with Parton's rerecording of \"I Will Always Love You\" from the \"Best Little Whorehouse in Texas Soundtrack\"), and reached #1 on the country charts in August 1982.Context_2: I Will Always Love You The song, \"I Will Always Love You\" was originally written and recorded in 1973 by American singer-songwriter, Dolly Parton.Context_3: La Grange (song) La Grange is a song by the American rock group ZZ Top, from their 1973 album \"Tres Hombres\".  One of ZZ Top's most successful songs, it was released as a single in 1973 and received extensive radio play, rising to No. 41 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in 1974.  The song refers to a brothel on the outskirts of La Grange, Texas (later called the \"Chicken Ranch\").  The brothel is also the subject of the Broadway play and film \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\", the latter starring Dolly Parton and Burt Reynolds.Context_4: Bubbling Over (album) Bubbling Over is the 12th solo studio album by Dolly Parton.  It was released in September 1973 by RCA Victor.  It was produced by Bob Ferguson (though, as with all of Parton's early albums for RCA Records, Porter Wagoner also had an uncredited hand in the production), and included the country top-twenty single \"Traveling Man\" (not to be confused with the Ricky Nelson song of the same name), a re-recording of a song which Parton had first included on 1971's \"Coat of Many Colors\" album.  \"Afraid to Live and Afraid of Dying\", a rare topical song by Parton, makes mention with the environmentalists of the early 1970s.Context_5: Eagle When She Flies Eagle When She Flies is Dolly Parton's 30th solo studio album, released on April 6, 1991.  Continuing the country sounds of 1989's \"White Limozeen\", the album featured collaborations with Lorrie Morgan and Ricky Van Shelton; additional supporting vocals were provided by Vince Gill and Emmylou Harris.  Dolly Parton's duet with Shelton, \"Rockin' Years\", topped the country charts, and the follow-up single co-written by Carl Perkins, \"Silver and Gold\", was a #15 country single.  Rounding out the hit singles was the title song \"Eagle When She Flies\", which only reached a #33 peak, despite spending 20 weeks on the Billboard Country Singles chart.  Her duet with Lorrie Morgan, \"Best Woman Wins\", appeared simultaneously on Lorrie Morgan's 1991 album \"Something in Red\".  She co-wrote the song \"Family\" with Carl Perkins and \"Wildest Dreams\" with Mac Davis.  The album also topped the U.S. country albums charts, Parton's first solo album to reach the top in a decade (and her last to do so until 2016) and reached #24 on the pop albums charts.  The album spent 73 weeks on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart.  It was her first album to reach number one album in the United States after 1980's \"9 to 5 and Odd Jobs.\"Context_6: The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (soundtrack) The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas film soundtrack was released along with the film in July 1982.  The album was produced by Gregg Perry.  In addition to the score of Carol Hall songs recorded for the stage soundtrack, the film soundtrack included two Dolly Parton compositions: \"Sneakin' Around\", which she performed as a duet with costar Burt Reynolds and a reworking of her 1974 classic \"I Will Always Love You\", the latter of which topped the U.S. country charts in September 1982.  Unlike the original 1974 version, the 1982 release of \"I Will Always Love You\" crossed over to the pop charts (#53 Pop and #17 Adult Contemporary) as well.Context_7: Burlap &amp; Satin Burlap & Satin is the now out-of-print 25th solo studio album by Dolly Parton.  Released on June 18, 1983, it straddled the line between pop and country sounds.  Consisting mostly of Parton's own compositions, two tracks were outtakes from the \"Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\" film: \"A Cowboy's Ways\" (a song intended for costar Burt Reynolds to perform in the film, that was ultimately cut out of the film) and \"A Gamble Either Way\".  The album's single, \"Potential New Boyfriend\" was a top twenty country single, and was accompanied by Parton's first ever music video.  Willie Nelson duetted on a cover of the Eddy Arnold hit \"I Really Don't Want to Know.Context_8: The Great Pretender (Dolly Parton album) The Great Pretender is Dolly Parton's 26th solo studio album, released in January 1984, and is composed of covers of hits from the 1950s and 1960s.  The album was produced by Val Garay.  It made heavy use of synthesizers and had a decidedly pop sound.  The first single, a remake of The Drifters' 1960 hit \"Save the Last Dance for Me\" was a top ten country single for Parton in early 1984 and came close to making the pop Top 40 as well (#45).  Dolly Parton's cover of the 1965 Petula Clark hit \"Downtown\" was the album's second single.  The title song was originally a hit for The Platters in 1956.Context_9: Straight Talk Straight Talk is an 1992 American romantic comedy film directed by Barnet Kellman and starring Dolly Parton and James Woods.  Parton did not receive solo star-billing in any other theatrically released films until the 2012 film \"Joyful Noise\", alongside Queen Latifah.  Her previous starring films had been \"9 to 5\" (1980), \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\" (1982), \"Rhinestone\" (1984), and \"Steel Magnolias\" (1989).Context_10: Heartbreak Express (song) \"Heartbreak Express\" is a song written and performed by American entertainer Dolly Parton.

It was developed in England and is still performed throughout the United Kingdom, generally during the Christmas and New Year season and, to a lesser extent, in other English-speaking countries.  Modern pantomime includes songs, gags, slapstick comedy and dancing, employs gender-crossing actors, and combines topical humour with a story loosely based on a well-known fairy tale, fable or folk tale.  It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers.Context_3: New York City The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.  With an estimated 2016 population of 8,537,673 distributed over a land area of about 302.6 sqmi , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.  Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.  A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media and entertainment, art, fashion, research, technology, education, politics, and sports, its fast pace defining the term \"New York minute\".  Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world.Context_4: Revolt of the Beavers Revolt of the Beavers was a children's play put on by the Federal Theater Project by Oscar Saul and Louis Lantz.  One critic described the play as \"Marxism a la Mother Goose\".  The show ran at the Adelphi Theatre in New York City from May 20, 1937, to June 19 of that year.  Jules Dassin and John Randolph were among the play's cast.Context_5: The Unconquered (2007 play) The Unconquered is a play for four actors by Torben Betts which premiered at the Byre Theatre, St Andrews in February 2007 before touring the United Kingdom (venues including the Tron Theatre in Glasgow, the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh and London's Arcola Theatre.)  It received critical acclaim and won the award for Best New Play at the Critics Awards for Theatre in Scotland, 2007.  Keith McIntyre's cartoon-like design was nominated for an award at the same time.  The production was remounted in 2008, and toured the country again before taking part in the Brits-off-Broadway Season in New York City followed by Trap Door Theatre's production in Chicago.Context_6: Fair Play for Cuba Committee The Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC) was an activist group set up in New York City in April 1960.  The FPCC's purpose was to provide grassroots support for the Cuban Revolution against attacks by the United States government, once Fidel Castro began openly admitting his commitment to Marxism and began the expropriation and nationalization of Cuban assets belonging to U.S. corporations.  The FPCC opposed the Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961, the imposition of the United States embargo against Cuba, and was sympathetic to the Cuban view during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.Context_7: Aylesbury Waterside Theatre Aylesbury Waterside Theatre is a £47 million theatre in Aylesbury, England, United Kingdom presenting a range of West End and touring musicals and plays, along with performances of opera and ballet and a Christmas pantomime.Context_8: Mother Goose The figure of Mother Goose is the imaginary author of a collection of fairy tales and nursery rhymes often published as \"Old Mother Goose's Rhymes\", as illustrated by Arthur Rackham in 1913.  As a character, she appears in one nursery rhyme.  A Christmas pantomime called \"Mother Goose\" is often performed in the United Kingdom.  The so-called \"Mother Goose\" rhymes and stories have formed the basis for many classic British pantomimes.  Mother Goose is generally depicted in literature and book illustration as an elderly country woman in a tall hat and shawl, a costume identical to the peasant costume worn in Wales in the early 20th century, but is sometimes depicted as a goose (usually wearing a bonnet).Context_9: Combination company A combination company was a theatrical touring company which performed only one play.  Unlike repertory companies, which performed multiple plays in rotation, combination companies used more elaborate and specialized scenery in their productions.  Repertory theatre had been popular in the United States through the 19th century, and it is not clear how the combination system originated.  Combination companies contributed to the early success of Broadway theatre, as most combination companies began their tours in New York City.  Combination companies were fueled by stars.  The Star agenda or star system that had been set in place in mid 19th century America helped greatly in the development of the combination company.  The idea of celebrity was at full force and people would flock to theater houses to see their favorite stars perform.  Stars made famous in New York would travel to stock theaters and perform limited engagements there.  “The engagements of the first important stars… were rare and special events”(Poggi 4).  Audiences would come in from all over to sold out performances at playhouses and see their favorite stars.  The Stock companies would cancel their normal repertory programs for a few nights to allow for the show of the star.  The star would be supported by the local company of actors in the play, which proved to be very frustrating to them (Poggi 5).  After the star left, the company returned to its repertory schedule as per usual.  Yet annoyed by the lack of talent from regional companies, the stars began to search for companies to tour with them.  They began to tour with two or three actors, and then eventually whole companies would tour with them and they would perform a repertory of plays (Wilmeth 200-201).  This switch to companies that support the stars for the whole tour was one more step in the transition from stock companies to combination companies.Context_10: Selkirk hurdle The Selkirk Hurdle is the term used by urban planners, railroad employees, politicians, and others to describe the route that must be taken by freight trains traveling between New York City and other points in downstate New York that are east of the Hudson River, and locations in the United States to the south and west.  There are no rail freight bridges or tunnels that cross the Hudson River south of Selkirk, which is 10 miles (16 km) south of Albany and the home of Selkirk Yard, a major CSX classification yard.  As a result, trains from Long Island and New York City (except for the borough of Staten Island which has a rail bridge to New Jersey) must travel 140 mi north to cross at Selkirk before continuing on their way.  Advocates claim that this detour and the inefficiencies that result force New York City to rely more heavily on relatively inefficient trucks than most parts of the United States, where freight trains are more common.  However, at least for traffic to and from the west, this route was touted for its efficiency as the \"Water Level Route\" by the New York Central Railroad because trains using it did not have to climb over the Appalachian Mountains, and it is still used by the New York Central's successor, CSX, for traffic to both sides of the Hudson River.Fact_1: Revolt of the BeaversFact_2: Revolt of the BeaversFact_3: Revolt of the BeaversFact_4: Mother GooseFact_5: Mother GooseQuestion: In which theatre of New York City did a play, described as Marxism but using the figure from a Christmas pantomime in the United Kingdom, perform?",

He won the College Football National Championship with the Florida State University Seminoles.  Ward played several years with the New York Knicks and started in the NBA Finals.  He was inducted in the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006.  An avid tennis player, Ward also displayed his skills at the Arthur Ashe Tennis Tournament in 1994.Context_2: Bear Bryant Paul William \"Bear\" Bryant (September 11, 1913 – January 26, 1983) was an American college football player and coach.  He was best known as the longtime head coach of the University of Alabama football team.  During his 25-year tenure as Alabama's head coach, he amassed six national championships and thirteen conference championships.  Upon his retirement in 1982, he held the record for most wins as head coach in collegiate football history with 323 wins.  The Paul W. Bryant Museum, Paul W. Bryant Hall, Paul W. Bryant Drive, and Bryant–Denny Stadium are all named in his honor at the University of Alabama.  He was also known for his trademark black and white houndstooth hat, deep voice, casually leaning up against the goal post during pre-game warmups, and holding his rolled-up game plan while on the sidelines.  Before arriving at Alabama, Bryant was head football coach at the University of Maryland, the University of Kentucky, and Texas A&M University.Context_3: 2012 Texas A&amp;M vs. Alabama football game The 2012 Texas A&M vs. Alabama football game was a college football game between the Texas A&M Aggies and Alabama Crimson Tide at Bryant–Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  This was the game where Texas A&M freshman quarterback and eventual Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel completed 24 of 31 passes, had 253 passing yards, and two passing touchdowns with 92 rushing yards to help No. 15 Texas A&M upset No. 1 Alabama 29–24, which led him to being the first freshman to win the Heisman Trophy.Context_4: Heisman curse The Heisman curse is a term coined to reference a two-part assertion of a negative future for the winning player of the Heisman Trophy.  The \"curse\" supposes that any college football player who wins the Heisman plays on a team that will likely lose its subsequent bowl game.  The trend of post-award failure has garnered the attention of the mainstream media.  Talk of a curse in relation to bowl results was particularly prevalent from 2003 to 2008, when six Heisman Trophy winners compiled a cumulative 1–5 bowl game record, and five of those six led number one ranked teams into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) National Championship Game as favorites (Heisman Trophy winners, including Reggie Bush, who gave back his Heisman Trophy, are 4–8 overall in the BCS National Championship Game and College Football Playoff National Championship, although prior to 2009 they were 1–6).  Additionally, the Heisman curse asserts that in most cases a Heisman winner will have either a poor career in the National Football League (NFL), or in fact not even see such a football career at all.  Although many Heisman winners have not enjoyed success at the professional level, including players like Matt Leinart, Andre Ware, Jason White, Rashaan Salaam, Eric Crouch, Ty Detmer, Troy Smith and Gino Torretta, proponents of the \"curse\" rarely cite highly successful players such as Barry Sanders, Charles Woodson, Eddie George, Tim Brown, Bo Jackson, Marcus Allen, Earl Campbell, and Tony Dorsett among the notables.Context_5: 2003 Cincinnati Bengals season The 2003 Cincinnati Bengals season was the team's 36th year in professional football and its 34th with the National Football League.  The Bengals are now under first year Head Coach Marvin Lewis, who replaced Dick LeBeau who was fired following the 2002 season after the worst season in Bengals history.  The Bengals had the first pick overall in the 2003 NFL Draft and drafted Heisman Trophy winner Carson Palmer with the first pick.  After a slow start, the Bengals got hot winning at midseason, winning four straight games to stand at 7–5, entering a key Week 14 matchup with the Baltimore Ravens with a chance to win the division.  However in the key showdown for first place the Bengals showed they were not quite ready for primetime as they were beaten 31–13.  The Bengals would rebound to win their next game against the San Francisco 49ers, but at 8–6 the Bengals could not get that ninth win, losing their last two games to spoil an effort to earn their first winning season in 13 years, finishing at 8–8.Context_6: Mark Ingram Jr. Mark Ingram Jr. (born December 21, 1989) is an American football running back for the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL).  He played college football for the University of Alabama, won the Heisman Trophy, and was a member of a national championship team.  The New Orleans Saints chose him in the first round of the 2011 NFL Draft.Context_7: Alabama Crimson Tide football The Alabama Crimson Tide football program represents the University of Alabama (variously Alabama, UA, or 'Bama) in the sport of American football.

The critical success of the album \"Shotgun Willie\" (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of \"Red Headed Stranger\" (1975) and \"Stardust\" (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music.  He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound.  Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana.Context_4: The Highwaymen (country supergroup) The Highwaymen was a country music supergroup composed of four of the genre's biggest artists well known for their pioneering influence on the outlaw country subgenre: Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson.  Active as a group between 1985 and 1995, these four artists recorded three major label albums as The Highwaymen: two on Columbia Records and one for Liberty Records.  Their Columbia works produced three chart singles, including the number one \"Highwayman\" in 1985.Context_5: Highwayman (song) \"Highwayman\" is a song written by American singer-songwriter Jimmy Webb, about a soul with incarnations in four different places in time and history: as a highwayman, a sailor, a construction worker on the Hoover Dam, and finally as a captain of a starship.  The song was influenced by the real-life hanged highwayman Jonathan Wild.  The dam builder verse alludes to the deaths of over one hundred men during the construction of Hoover Dam near Boulder City, Nevada.  Webb first recorded the song on his album \"El Mirage\", released in May 1977.  The following year, Glen Campbell recorded his version, which was released on his 1979 album \"Highwayman\".  In 1985, the song became the inspiration for the naming of the supergroup The Highwaymen, which featured Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson.  Their first album, \"Highwayman\", became a number one platinum-selling album, and their version of the song went to number one on the Hot Country Songs \"Billboard\" chart in a twenty-week run.  Their version earned Webb a Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 1986.  The song has since been recorded by other artists.  Webb himself included a different version on his 1996 album \"Ten Easy Pieces\", a live version on his 2007 album \"Live and at Large\", and a duet version with Mark Knopfler on 2010 album \"Just Across the River\".Context_6: Repossessed (album) Repossessed is an album by Kris Kristofferson, released on Mercury Records in 1986 (see 1986 in music).

The title track peaked at #12 on the singles chart, while \"There Ain't No Good Chain Gang\" reached #2; the album itself peaked at #23.  The album features a pair of duets with Waylon Jennings, one of which was the \"There Ain't No Good Chain Gang\" single; it was one of Cash's first collaborations with Jennings, and the two recorded songs together throughout the 1980s, including a separate album entitled \"Heroes\".

Also included is a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain? ,\" from \"Pendulum\".  The album also includes the song \"Love Me Like You Used To,\" which was later recorded by fellow country singer Tanya Tucker, and became a country hit for her.  Following the release of this album and a duet album with Jennings in 1986, Cash moved to Mercury Records as a result of Columbia's fading interest in his music, though he later returned to Columbia for the second Highwaymen album.Fact_1: Rockabilly BluesFact_2: Willie NelsonQuestion:  \"The Twentieth Century is Almost Over\" was re-recorded five years later by Cash and Waylon Jennings,  Kris Kristofferson, and  Willie Nelson, one of the most recognized artists in what type of music?",

Most countries used the Hilux name for the entire life of the series but in North America, the Hilux name was retired in 1976 in favor of \"Truck\", \"Pickup Truck\", or \"Compact Truck\".  In North America the popular option package, the SR5 (Sport Rally 5-Speed), was colloquially used as a model name for the truck, even though the option package was also used on other Toyota models like the 1972 to 1979 Corolla.  In 1984, the Toyota Trekker, the camper version of the Hilux, was renamed as the 4Runner in Australia and North America, and as the Hilux Surf in Japan.  In 1995, Toyota introduced a new pickup model, the Tacoma in North America, discontinuing the Hilux/Pickup there.

It is a form of Affirmative action.  Although race is the overriding factor, it includes measures such as Employment Preference, skills development, ownership, management, socioeconomic development, and preferential procurement.Context_4: Affirmative action Affirmative action, also known as reservation in India and Nepal, positive action in the UK, and employment equity (in a narrower context) in Canada and South Africa, is the policy of favoring members of a disadvantaged group who suffer or have suffered from discrimination within a culture.  Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve goals such as bridging inequalities in employment and pay, increasing access to education, promoting diversity, and redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances.Context_5: Reverse discrimination Reverse discrimination is discrimination against members of a dominant or majority group, in favor of members of a minority or historically disadvantaged group.  Groups may be defined in terms of race, gender, ethnicity, or other factors.  This discrimination may seek to redress social inequalities under which minority groups have had less access to privileges enjoyed by the majority group.  In such cases it is intended to remove discrimination that minority groups may already face.  The label reverse discrimination may also be used to highlight the discrimination inherent in affirmative action programs.  Reverse discrimination can be defined as the unequal treatment of members of the majority groups resulting from preferential policies, as in college admissions or employment, intended to remedy earlier discrimination against minorities.Context_6: SA Waste Holdings SA Waste Holdings (Pty) Ltd is a waste management company, based in Johannesburg, South Africa, in Gauteng Province.  It was launched in 1990, and as of 2003 boasted 626 staff members.  The company boasts clients in the retail, commercial, entertainment and gambling sectors.  SA Waste is a BEE (Black Economic Empowerment) conscious company, and has a Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) subsidiary, Kofifi Thusano (Pty) Ltd.Context_7: Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE or B-BBEE as written by the South African government) is a form of economic empowerment initiated by the South African government in response to criticism against narrow-based empowerment instituted in the country during 2003/2004.  While narrow-based black economic empowerment led to the enrichment of a few previously disadvantaged individuals (Black African, Coloured or Indian), the goal of broad-based empowerment is to distribute wealth across as broad a spectrum of previously disadvantaged South African society as possible.  In contrast, narrow-based empowerment measures only equity ownership and management representation.Context_8: Qualifying Small Enterprises A Qualifying Small Enterprise (QSE) is one of the categories of South African businesses as per the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment Act.  \"The Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act (53/2003): Codes of Good Practice on Black Economic Empowerment\" was gazetted on 9 February 2007.  A Qualifying Small Enterprise is a business with a turnover between R10 million and R50 million and is measured using the QSE Scorecard.Context_9: Labour discrimination Labor discrimination as defined by Kenneth Arrow is “the valuation in the market place of personal characteristics of the worker that are unrelated to worker productivity”.  It can be thus understood as the differentiation of workers based on characteristics such as color, race, origin, gender etc. that can be classified as factors that do not have a role in determining his or her productivity.  There are multiple dimensions that need to be considered when discussing such discrimination.  The most obvious is that the group discriminated against is paid less for identical jobs.  This is known as wage discrimination and is the most prevalent form of discrimination.  The attempt to combat such a form of discrimination can be seen in increasing equal pay legislation in different countries.  Examples of this are the Equal Pay Act (1970), Sex Discrimination Act (1975), and Employment Protection Act (1975), but the effectiveness of such legislation is subject to much debate.  Secondly, that the level of unemployment for the disadvantaged group in general is higher than that of other groups that do not face such discrimination.  Thirdly, there is discrimination based on the kind of jobs that they have access to, the discriminated group given preference for repetitive and menial tasks.This is known as employment discrimination, where an individual is excluded from a job that is worked on by a person with equal productivity.  When this happens, the disadvantaged group is employed for a job he or she is over-qualified for, simply because the group does not have access to better paying jobs in par to their counterparts and are denied opportunities of recruitment and promotion.  A general misconception prevails that discrimination is only practiced by the employer.  This is not true.  In addition to employer discrimination, customer discrimination can also exist in the market.  Customers may prefer to transact with only a certain kind of people.Context_10: R v Kapp R v Kapp is a 2008 Supreme Court of Canada case dealing with an appeal from a British Columbia Court of Appeal decision that held that a communal fishing license granted exclusively to Aboriginals did not violate section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal on the basis that the distinction based on an enumerated or analogous ground in a government program will not constitute discrimination under s. 15 if, under s. 15(2): (1) the program has an ameliorative or remedial purpose; and (2) the program targets a disadvantaged group identified by the enumerated or analogous grounds.  In other words the court found that the prima facie discrimination was allowed because it was aimed at improving the situation of a disadvantaged group as allowed by s. 15(2) of the Charter.Fact_1: Black Economic EmpowermentFact_2: Black Economic EmpowermentFact_3: Affirmative actionQuestion: What is the name of this policy of favoring members of a disadvantaged group who suffer or have suffered from discrimination within a culture of which Black Economic Empowerment is a form?

It played a prominent and influential role in the expansion of the Civil Rights movement in Durham.  Terry Sanford, its founder, managed to develop that through the help and involvement of the North Carolina Fund.  A Member of the Democratic Party, Sanford was the former governor of North Carolina and was highly respected for his intervention in the improvement of public education.  Indeed, in the 1960s, the education system in place in North Carolina was very poor as one quarter of the adults above 25 years old had received an education inferior to sixth grade, making most of them illiterate.  Because of the high success of the program, the concept developed through the North Carolina Fund was mimicked throughout the nation, transforming what initially was a state wide program to a national program.  Throughout this movement, activism played a fundamental role as the main aim of the program consisted in changing the economic situation of a state through the use of political and social power.Context_2: Welcome to Durham, USA Welcome to Durham, USA is a documentary about gang violence in Durham, North Carolina.Context_3: Louis Austin Louis Austin (1898-1971) was an African American journalist, leader and social activist.  Austin purchased \"The Carolina Times\" in 1927 and transformed it into an institution that aided African Americans in their fight for freedom and equality in North Carolina.  He used a new approach to Civil Rights issues in Durham, incorporating lower and middle class blacks, unlike the moderate, accommodationist approach of the black elite in Durham during this time.  Austin's unusual strategy of advocating for the majority of blacks to have a voice in society succeeded in galvanizing a broader segment of the African American community in Durham to act for social change.  Austin's approach to black activism helped lay the groundwork for the modern Civil Rights Movement in Durham in the late 1950s and 1960s, which also encouraged lower-income blacks to become politically active.  His strategies—which were once considered too radical by his peers—allowed Austin to maintain his influence in Durham well into the 1950s and 1960s.  In doing so, Austin created a lasting impact for Durham.Context_4: Research Triangle The Research Triangle, commonly referred to as simply The Triangle, is a region in the Piedmont of North Carolina in the United States, anchored by North Carolina State University, Duke University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the cities of Raleigh and Durham and the town of Chapel Hill.  The eight-county region, officially named the Raleigh–Durham–Chapel Hill combined statistical area (CSA), comprises the Raleigh and Durham–Chapel Hill metropolitan areas and the Dunn, Henderson, Oxford, and Sanford Micropolitan Statistical Areas.  A 2013 Census estimate put the population at 2,037,430, making it the second largest metropolitan area in the state of North Carolina behind Charlotte.  The Raleigh–Durham television market includes a broader 24-county area which includes Fayetteville, and has a population of 2,726,000 persons.Context_5: Erwin Mill Erwin Mill was a textile mill in Durham, North Carolina that operated between the years of 1893 and 1986.  After seeing the success of other cotton mills in the Northeast and locally in Durham, entrepreneur Benjamin N. Duke incorporated the mill in 1892 and recruited William H. Erwin to manage the enterprise.  The mill’s success in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was the result of Erwin’s and his successors’ exceptional management tactics, even when the factory hit obstacles such as the Great Depression and the unionization of its workers.  The mill grew quickly in the late 19th century and early 20th century, became one of North Carolina’s largest cotton mills.  It originally produced muslin pouches for tobacco, but the mill would later expand its production to other fabrics, becoming one of the largest producers of denim in the world during the early 1900s.  Workers at the mill enjoyed some of the best working conditions and highest wages in textile factories throughout the southern United States.  Mill employees would later sign union-friendly labor agreements that were radical to the southern textile industry in the early to mid 20th century.  The establishment of homes, businesses and recreation areas in the mill village was a significant factor in the development of the West Durham, especially the Ninth Street business district and the Old West Durham Neighborhood.  Erwin Mill No. 1 is on the National Register of Historic Places and the mill village of West Durham is a National Historic District.  An apartment complex, office building and shopping center of the same name that are built on the original site also commemorate the factory.Context_6: The Agronomist The Agronomist is a 2003 American documentary directed by Jonathan Demme, and starring Jean Dominique.  The documentary follows the life of Dominique, who ran Haiti's first independent radio station, Radio Haiti-Inter, during multiple repressive regimes.Context_7: North Carolina Specialty Hospital North Carolina Specialty Hospital (NCSH) is a specialty hospital located in northern Durham, North Carolina.  The hospital provides orthopaedic, ophthalmogic, otolaryngology (ENT), plastic, and general surgery care, as well as pain management techniques and podiatric care.  NCSH is the oldest hospital in Durham, dating back to 1926, when it was formed as an eye, ear, nose, and throat hospital originally known as McPherson Hospital, named after Dr. Samuel McPherson, an EENT specialist.  In the early-1990s, the hospital was renamed as the North Carolina Eye and Ear Hospital.  It was located at the time in its original building in downtown Durham, near the East Campus of Duke University.  In May 2005, NCSH moved to its current location in northern Durham, and was renamed as North Carolina Specialty Hospital in 2000.Context_8: Edgemont (Durham, North Carolina) The Edgemont neighborhood is a community of mill works located in Durham, North Carolina.  Previously known as Smoky Hollow, this area developed around the Durham Hosiery Mills in the late 19th century.  Durham was a “raw whistle-stop village” along the Great North Carolina Central Rail Road that transformed into one of the largest tobacco cities in the United States.  The Durham City Bull became one of the better-known tobacco trademarks with the help of the big players in the industry, W. T. Blackwell and Company and Julian Carr.  The success of these tobacco mills started overflowing into other industries, mainly textile mills that produced cloth bags, socks, and other hosieries.  As demands rose, communities began growing and changing around the factories.  A shift in the racial make up of the workforce was reflected in Edgemont’s shift to a more African American dominant community as the years progressed.  Julian Carr Jr. was one of the first to allow black workers in factory level jobs to help cope with the high demands.  This industrialist’s decision to reach over the race barrier is part of what made Durham “the City of the New South.”  The Edgemont Neighborhood is just one of many examples of how Durham became one of the more progressive and tolerant locations for African Americans in the country.Context_9: Downtown Durham Historic District Downtown Durham Historic District is a national historic district located at Durham, Durham County, North Carolina.

Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (briefly \"Nick Cave – Man or Myth?\"  and later \"Nick Cave and the Cavemen\") formed in late 1983 in Melbourne, Australia, by five musicians, including several former members of the group The Birthday Party shortly after this band's demise, and is thus seen as its continuation.Context_2: Anita Lane Anita Louise Lane (born ca. 1959) is an Australian singer-songwriter who was briefly a member of the Bad Seeds with Nick Cave and Mick Harvey, and has collaborated with both former band mates.  Lane has released two solo albums, \"Dirty Pearl\" (1993) and \"Sex O'Clock\" (2001).Context_3: Thomas Wydler Thomas Wydler (born 9 October 1959, Zurich, Switzerland), is a Swiss musician best known for being a core member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, of which he has been a drummer since 1985.  Prior to joining them, he was a member of the experimental German band Die Haut.  Wydler has been present on almost every Bad Seeds album, making his debut appearance on the group's third album \"Kicking Against The Pricks\" (1986).  After the departure of founding member Mick Harvey in January 2009, Wydler became the longest-serving member of the Bad Seeds apart from singer Nick Cave.Context_4: Warren Ellis (musician) Warren Ellis (born 14 February 1965) is an Australian-French musician and composer.

Ellis plays violin, piano, bouzouki, guitar, flute, mandolin, tenor guitar, and viola.  Ellis has been a member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds since 1994.Context_5: Nocturama (album) Nocturama is the twelfth studio album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released in 2003.  It so far has a Metacritic score of 73 out of 100 based on \"generally favorable reviews\".  To date, it is the last Bad Seeds album to feature founding member Blixa Bargeld.  This album reunited Nick Cave with Nick Launay, who had produced \"Junkyard\" by The Birthday Party 21 years earlier.  It was recorded in one week during an Australian tour in March 2002.Context_6: Grinderman (album) Grinderman is the eponymous debut studio album by alternative rock band Grinderman, a side project of members of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released on March 5, 2007 on Mute Records in Europe and ANTI- in the United States.  Aiming to recreate the more raw, primal sound of all former related projects such as The Birthday Party, \"Grinderman\"'s lyrical and musical content diverged significantly to Nick Cave's concurrent work with The Bad Seeds, whose last studio album, \"Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus\" (2004), was primarily blues, gospel and alternative-orientated in stark contrast to the raw sound of the early Bad Seeds albums.  Incidentally, the musical direction of \"Grinderman\" influenced The Bad Seeds' next studio album, \"Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! \" (2008).Context_7: Original Seeds Original Seeds: Songs that inspired Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds is a compilation album by Various Artists, which was initially released in June 1998.  It was re-titled as \"Original Seeds Vol 1: Songs that inspired Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds\" when the follow-up \"Original Seeds Vol 2: Songs that inspired Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds\" appeared in 2004.

As a part of the Neue Deutsche Welle scene (especially \"electropunk\" ) in Germany they pioneered electronic body music.  After recording four ten-minute cassettes, they released their sole album in 1981.  The self-titled album was mixed at Conny Plank's studio in Köln.  The group made several live appearances throughout 1981 and 1982 and were occasionally joined by Anita Lane (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds) and Hideto Sasaki.  The album carried the single \"Los Niños del Parque\" which became an underground hit and has been cited by many prominent Chicago house and Detroit techno DJ's as a crucial influence.Context_10: From Her to Eternity (song) From Her to Eternity is a song by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds appearing on their debut album \"From Her to Eternity\".

            "input": "Context_1: Daniel Elliott Huger Daniel Elliott Huger (June 28, 1779August 21, 1854) was a United States Senator from South Carolina.  Born on Limerick plantation, Berkeley County (near Charleston), his father was Daniel Huger, a Continental Congressman and U.S. Representative from South Carolina.  Daniel Elliott pursued classical studies in Charleston and graduated from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University) in 1798.  He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1799, beginning practice in Charleston.  In 1800 he married Isabella Johannes Middleton-daughter of Declaration of Independence signer Arthur Middleton.  He was a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1804 to 1819 and from 1830 to 1832, and was a brigadier general of State troops in 1814.  He was judge of the circuit court from 1819 to 1830, and was a member of the South Carolina State Senate from 1838 to 1842.  He was an opposition member of the State nullification convention in 1832.Context_2: Benjamin Huger (American Revolution) Benjamin Huger (1746 – 11 May 1779) was one of five Huger brothers from South Carolina who served in the American Revolutionary War.  Huger became a close friend of La Fayette, having met him upon his arrival near Georgetown in 1777, and his son Francis Kinloch Huger had a role in getting La Fayette temporarily released from prison at Olomouc in the 1790s.Context_3: Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette (] ; 6 September 1757 – 20 May 1834), in the United States often known simply as Lafayette, was a French aristocrat and military officer who fought in the American Revolutionary War.  A close friend of George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson, Lafayette was a key figure in the French Revolution of 1789 and the July Revolution of 1830.Context_4: Implied powers Implied powers, in the United States, are those powers authorized by the Constitution that, while not stated, seem to be implied by powers expressly stated.  When George Washington asked Alexander Hamilton to defend the constitutionality of the First Bank of the United States against the protests of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Attorney General Edmund Randolph, Hamilton produced what has now become the classic statement for implied powers.  Hamilton argued that the sovereign duties of a government implied the right to use means adequate to its ends.  Although the United States government was sovereign only as to certain objects, it was impossible to define all the means which it should use, because it was impossible for the founders to anticipate all future exigencies.  Hamilton noted that the \"general welfare clause\" and the \"necessary and proper clause\" gave elasticity to the constitution.  Hamilton won the argument with Washington, who signed his Bank Bill into law.Context_5: Anti-Administration party The \"Anti-Administration party\" (1789–1792) was an informal faction led by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson that opposed policies of then United States Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton in the first term (1789–1792) of President George Washington.  This was not an organized political party, but an unorganized faction.  Most had been Anti-Federalists in 1788, meaning they opposed ratification of the Constitution of the United States.  However, the situation was fluid, with members moving in and out.Context_6: Francis Kinloch Huger Colonel Dr. Francis Kinloch Huger (September 17, 1773 – February 14, 1855), a trained physician and artillery officer, was a scion of the Huger family of South Carolina.  A member of the South Carolina House of Representatives and South Carolina Senate, he is best known for his leadership of a failed November 1794 attempt to rescue Lafayette from captivity during the wars surrounding the French Revolution.Context_7: Enoch Edwards (surgeon) Enoch Edwards (1751 – April 18, 1802, Frankford, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) was an American physician and a leading Patriot during the American Revolution.  Born in Lower Dublin Township, Pennsylvania, Edwards was a member of the Provincial Congress in Carpenters' Hall on June 18, 1776, which led to the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776.  He was also a signatory of the 1790 Pennsylvania Constitution.  During the war he served as attending physician for George Washington, was a close friend of both Benjamin Rush and Thomas Jefferson, and kept up correspondence with James Monroe and John Quincy Adams.Context_8: Alexander Hamilton Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.  He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and \"The New York Post\" newspaper.  As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration.  He took the lead in the funding of the states' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military.  This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party.  They favored strong states based in rural America and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national army and navy.  They denounced Hamilton as too friendly toward Britain and toward monarchy in general, and too oriented toward cities, business and banking.Context_9: Democratic-Republican Party The Democratic-Republican Party was an American political party formed by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in 1791–93 to oppose the centralizing policies of the new Federalist Party run by Alexander Hamilton (1755/57-1804), who was secretary of the treasury and chief architect of George Washington's administration.  The new party controlled the presidency and Congress, as well as most states, from 1801 to 1825, during the First Party System.  It began in 1791 as one faction in Congress, and included many politicians who had been opposed to the new constitution.  They called themselves \"Republicans\" after their ideology, Republicanism.

            "input": "Context_1: The Society of Floristry Limited The Society of Floristry Limited was formed in 1951 to meet the growing need for professional recognition for florists. Its first major task, after forming a Council of directors composed of leading florists in the industry, was to write, run and mark examinations in floristry skills and theory, which it did successfully for almost 49 years.  It developed into an educational and standard-setting body which pioneered the concept of floristry as a profession, running regular workshops and educational seminars for florists undertaking study and continuing professional development.  The Society also ran a highly successful trade show for many years, enabling the best exponents of the craft to showcase their skills and talents, and for the support industries in the trade to launch and promote their product.  These shows were attended by thousands of florists and students over the years, raising standards and pushing back the boundaries of commercial floral design.  The cornerstone of the success of the Society was the ability of training providers to draw down Government funding for courses which supported what became the gold standard qualifications in the UK for florists, the Intermediate Certificate of the Society of Floristry (ICSF) and the National Diploma of the Society of Floristry (NDSF).  When the ability to draw this funding was removed a few years ago in an initiative to reduce the number of organisations awarding recognised qualifications, the number of florists able to afford to attend colleges and the ability of those colleges to offer courses toward the examinations was severely restricted.  As a consequence, the number coming forward to be examined dropped off significantly, and the pass rate amongst those who did fell also.  The Society did not want to see a situation develop where its standards were eroded, and entered into negotiations with NPTC City and Guilds to write recognised qualifications at Higher Education level to replace the well-recognised and valued ICSF and NDSF.  The courses came into existence during 2006 - see http://www.nptc.org.uk/qualifications/default.asp?area=130.  This had a number of advantages for candidates: Colleges were funded so courses were available and more affordable; college support for learning needs could be accessed; the standards and skills required became more transparent and accessible.  However, the result for the Society was that its reason for existing was seriously eroded.  On 28.2.10 the Society ceased trading and was acquired and absorbed into the British Florist Association.Context_2: Whistling in Dixie Whistling in Dixie is a 1942 crime comedy film, the second of three starring Red Skelton as murder mystery writer and amateur crime solver Wally Benton (aka.  The Fox) and Ann Rutherford as his fiancee.  The pair are called upon to solve a crime in the American South.  The film also re-introduces Rags Ragland, playing dual roles as twins, the mostly-reformed Chester, as well as his villainous brother from the first film.  The film turns into a romantic comedy mystery, complete with death traps, corrupt politicians and lost gold, ending with a frenetic fight at the end between Wally Benton and both of Rags Ragland's characters.Context_3: Meet the People Meet the People (1944) is a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical comedy film made during World War II, and starring Lucille Ball and Dick Powell and featuring Virginia O'Brien, Bert Lahr, Rags Ragland and June Allyson.  The film takes its title from a successful Los Angeles stage revue, which ran on Broadway from December 25, 1940 to May 10, 1941.  Vaughn Monroe and his orchestra, Spike Jones and his City Slickers, and Virginia O'Brien were also in the original stage cast.  O'Brien sings the hit song \"Say We're Sweethearts Again\".Context_4: Arne Skarpsno Arne Skarpsno (May 7, 1926 – March 22, 2008) was a Norwegian philanthropist.

He and his wife Gerd would distribute packed lunches to the needy on the streets of Oslo.  He was awarded the King's Medal of Merit in 1997 for his volunteer work.  In 2007 a bust of him was introduced at the area informally known as \"Plata\" (\"The Platter\") in downtown Oslo, the city's center point for heroin and illegal drugs trade for several years.  Skarpsno was present at the introduction and he urged the general population to do more for other people.  Having taken a blood test in May 2006, it became clear that he had cancer, and he was admitted to the Akershus University Hospital in November the same year.  There a kidney and a tumor were removed.  He died at Akershus University Hospital.Context_5: Sleeman, Ontario Sleeman is an unincorporated community located in Rainy River District in Northwestern Ontario, Canada.  The town site is located in the center of Dawson.  The original town site was along the Rainy River some 3 km south but in the early 1900s when the steam ships that traveled from Fort Frances to Rainy River and then to Rat Portage Via Lake of the Woods carrying Logs, Lumber, mail and other supplies stopped probably because the Canadian Northern Railway had finished its bridge and rail line from Winnipeg to International Falls and the docks of the great lakes located in Fort William and Port Arthur now known as Thunder Bay the town moved from the river to the rail line.  The original store, coffee shop, post office building still stands today and has been renovated into a home.  The town for many years held many stores, a large hotel, coffee shops, car dealership, school and a busy rail depot that served the Northern communities along Highway 621.  A restaurant called The Green Onion was the local favourite, it was open 7 days a week and held indoor livery stables below for the travels from Morson who came to town to meet the trains, liquor was served here as well.  Today there is only one business left, the Canada Postal outlet.  Lowes Lumber a local business for over 80 years went into bankruptcy and closed its doors in 2014.  Only about 20 homes remain, even though an official town plan was made to accommodate many more.  The rail siding was removed in 1993, the last of the CN hotel burned away in the late 1980s and the grocery store was demolished when the natural gas line was installed to serve the larger communities along Highway 11.Context_6: Cotton paper Cotton paper, also known as rag paper, is made using cotton linters or cotton from used cloth (rags) as the primary material.  Important documents are often printed on cotton paper, because it is known to last many years without deterioration.  Cotton paper is superior in both strength and durability to wood pulp-based paper, which may contain high concentrations of acids, and also absorbs ink or toner better.  Different grades of cotton paper can be produced.Context_7: Niles Canyon ghost The Niles Canyon ghost story is the Northern California variation on the vanishing hitchhiker archetype.  There are many different variations of this story depending on whom you ask.  All stories include a girl being involved in some sort of motorized vehicle accident on February 26 (year often changed).  One variation of the story includes a girl being involved in a car crash on Niles Canyon road (off the 680 freeway in Sunol, California) on the way to her prom.  The girl died on impact and to this day is said to haunt Niles Canyon road every February 26.  The tale of the haunting goes that people traveling along Niles Canyon road (now Highway 84) on the night of February 26 will see a normal-looking high school-aged girl walking along the road in a prom dress (many people have said it is white).  People traveling along the road (mostly those traveling alone) have said to have stopped and offered the girl a ride.  She accepts the ride, giving the driver an address across the bridge (either Dumbarton or Bay Bridge depending on the storyteller).  Once the driver gets to the beginning of the bridge, the girl will disappear.  Sometimes people have gone to the address to find that a girl many years ago matching that description once lived there.  Today, many people will travel along this treacherous pitch black road in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the Niles Canyon ghost.Context_8: Camelford water pollution incident The Camelford water pollution incident involved the accidental contamination of the drinking water supply to the town of Camelford, Cornwall, in July 1988.  Twenty tonnes of aluminium sulphate was inadvertently added to the water supply, raising the concentration to 3,000 times the admissible level.  As the aluminium sulphate broke down it produced several tonnes of sulphuric acid which \"stripped a cocktail of chemicals from the pipe networks as well as lead and copper piping in people’s homes.\"  Many people who came into contact with the contaminated water experienced a range of short-term health effects, and many victims suffered long-term effects whose implications remained unclear as of 2012 .  There has been no rigorous examination or monitoring of the health of the victims since the incident, which is Britain's worst mass poisoning event.  Inquests on people who died many years later found very high levels of aluminium in the brain.  Dame Barbara Clayton led a Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution enquiry into the incident.Context_9: Caledonian Curling Club The Caledonian Curling Club (also known as the Callie Curling Club) has been one of the most prominent curling rinks in Canada for many years.

Over the course of the two-year period Van Gogh lived in several places.  He left Brussels, where he had studied for about a year in 1881, to return to his parent's home in Etten (North Brabant), where he made studies of some of the residents of the town.  In January 1882 Van Gogh went to The Hague where he studied with his cousin-in-law Anton Mauve and set up a studio, funded by Mauve.  During the ten years of Van Gogh's artistic career from 1881 to 1890 Vincent's brother Theo would be a continuing source of inspiration and financial support; his first financial support began in 1880 funding Vincent while he lived in Brussels.Context_2: Andries Bonger Andries Bonger (20 May 1861 – 20 January 1936), nicknamed \"Dries\", was Johanna van Gogh-Bonger's favorite brother.

Participation in the annual exhibition of Les XX was for members and by invitation only.  Van Gogh's choice proves that he was going for more than a simple selection of paintings he considered superior, but that he was willing to provide a well reasoned summary of his years of work in Provence.  Evidently this notion remained neglected, and even more: it was washed away by the scandal his works provoked.  Then the same works were again shown at the annual exhibition of the Artistes Indépendants in Paris which offered space for an expansion of the display: this was done by Theo van Gogh, the brother of Vincent, who was suffering from long lasting mental problems.Context_8: Theo van Gogh (film director) Theodoor \"Theo\" van Gogh (] ; 23 July 19572 November 2004) was a Dutch film director, film producer, television director, television producer, television presenter, screenwriter, actor, critic and author.Context_9: Copies by Vincent van Gogh Copies by Vincent van Gogh form an important group of paintings executed by Vincent van Gogh between 1887 and early 1890.

Seeking to be reinvigorated artistically, Van Gogh did more than 30 copies of works by some of his favorite artists.  About twenty-one of the works were copies after, or inspired by, Jean-François Millet.  Rather than replicate, Van Gogh sought to translate the subjects and composition through his perspective, color, and technique.  Spiritual meaning and emotional comfort were expressed through symbolism and color.  His brother Theo van Gogh would call the pieces in the series some of his best work.Context_10: Murder in Amsterdam Murder in Amsterdam: The Death of Theo Van Gogh and the Limits of Tolerance is a 2006 book by Ian Buruma. \" The Guardian\" describes it as, \"part reportage, part essay.\"  It explores the impact of mass immigration from Muslim countries on Dutch culture through the lens of the murder of film director and anti-immigration activist, Theo van Gogh.Fact_1: Chris Carter (screenwriter)Fact_2: Theo van Gogh (film director)Question: Do filmmakers Chris Carter and Theo van Gogh share the same nationality?",

At midseason, the team traded Speedy Claxton to the New Orleans Hornets for All-Star guard Baron Davis, and dealt Clifford Robinson to the New Jersey Nets.

Better-preserved specimens later demonstrated that the fossils were not true feeding trails, as there was no evidence of turning by the life form that supposedly left them.

Along with other General Baptist chapels in Sussex, the congregation moved towards Unitarian views in the mid-18th century; this caused a schism which resulted in a new chapel being formed at nearby Wivelsfield.

The chapel is set back from Ditchling's main street and has an adjoining house (built in 1672) and graveyard, all of which contribute to the character of the conservation area which covers the centre of Ditchling village.

A year later, in April 1934, he resigned the Rectorship and stopped taking part in Nazi Party meetings, but remained a member of the Nazi Party until its dismantling at the end of World War II.  The denazification hearings immediately after World War II led to Heidegger's dismissal from Freiburg, banning him from teaching.  In 1949, after several years of investigation, the French military finally classified Heidegger as a \"Mitläufer\" or \"Nazi follower\".  The teaching ban was lifted in 1951 and Heidegger was granted \"emeritus\" status in 1953, but he was never allowed to resume his philosophy chair.Context_2: Mark Wrathall Mark Wrathall (born 1965) is professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Riverside.

The rivalry was at its height during the 1950s and 1960s, when both teams were highly ranked and during which time both teams claimed a national championship.  The rivalry died down from the 1970s to the 1990s, owing to Ole Miss not returning to conference or national prominence since the 1970s and because LSU has seen new rivalries emerge when the SEC split into two divisions in 1992, most notably Alabama, Arkansas, Auburn, and Florida.  Even though the rivalry has not attracted the same national attention in recent years, it still stirs up passion in both Oxford and Baton Rouge.Context_7: Civil War (college football game) The Civil War is the colloquial name for an American college football rivalry game played annually in Oregon, between the Ducks of the University of Oregon in Eugene and the Beavers of Oregon State University in Corvallis.
